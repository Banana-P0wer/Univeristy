6,cv618,8974,29,how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .,pos
6,cv618,8974,30,the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .,pos

6,cv618,8974,32,he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .,pos
6,cv618,8974,33,"compared to "" seven , "" though , the game is light and comical .",pos
6,cv618,8974,34,"because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously .",pos
6,cv618,8974,35,"so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to .",pos
6,cv618,8974,36,what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .,pos
6,cv618,8974,37,"if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense .",pos
6,cv618,8974,38,"but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility .",pos
6,cv618,8974,39,perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .,pos
6,cv618,8974,40,"while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen .",pos
6,cv618,8974,41,we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable .,pos
6,cv618,8974,42,"the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .",pos
6,cv618,8974,43,michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .,pos
6,cv618,8974,44,"douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance .",pos
6,cv618,8974,45,"his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody .",pos
6,cv618,8974,46,can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?,pos
6,cv618,8974,47,what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?,pos
6,cv618,8974,48,"douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his "" falling down "" persona ) .",pos
6,cv618,8974,49,"the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical .",pos
6,cv618,8974,50,"sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother .",pos
6,cv618,8974,51,"deborah kara unger ( from "" crash "" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good .",pos
6,cv618,8974,52,"in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas .",pos
6,cv618,8974,53,"james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas' predicament .",pos
6,cv618,8974,54,"another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from "" shine "" ) as the book editor .",pos
6,cv618,8974,55,"but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life .",pos
6,cv618,8974,56,"the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs .",pos
6,cv618,8974,57,what is essential for this film to work is the writing .,pos
6,cv618,8974,58,"john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments .",pos
6,cv618,8974,59,this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did .,pos
6,cv618,8974,60,"however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot .",pos
6,cv618,8974,61,"and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films .",pos
6,cv619,12462,0,"originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers .",pos
6,cv619,12462,1,"based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) ,",pos
6,cv619,12462,2,starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles .,pos
6,cv619,12462,3,plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia .,pos
6,cv619,12462,4,"the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour .",pos
6,cv619,12462,5,"critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler .",pos
6,cv619,12462,6,"this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers .",pos
6,cv619,12462,7,"admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time .",pos
6,cv619,12462,8,"but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings .",pos
6,cv619,12462,9,"this film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv's welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) .",pos
6,cv619,12462,10,"unfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie .",pos
6,cv619,12462,11,"on the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about "" drinking lemonade "" and "" staying out until 10 "" with danny in "" summer nights "" ) , and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i",pos
6,cv619,12462,12,am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) .,pos
6,cv619,12462,13,"make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights .",pos
6,cv619,12462,14,"and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue .",pos
6,cv619,12462,15,"little known facts : henry winkler , of tv's happy days' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career .",pos
6,cv619,12462,16,both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture .,pos
6,cv619,12462,17,"conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john's sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) .",pos
6,cv620,24265,0,"set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create .",pos
6,cv620,24265,1,"christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues .",pos
6,cv620,24265,2,"it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip .",pos
6,cv620,24265,3,"as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel .",pos
6,cv620,24265,4,i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school .,pos
6,cv620,24265,5,i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it .,pos
6,cv620,24265,6,"as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore .",pos
6,cv620,24265,7,"i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers .",pos
6,cv620,24265,8,"the movie has a similar effect , but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel .",pos
6,cv620,24265,9,"for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on .",pos
6,cv620,24265,10,both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout .,pos
6,cv620,24265,11,the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does .,pos
6,cv620,24265,12,"as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining .",pos
6,cv620,24265,13,lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference .,pos
6,cv620,24265,14,screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it .,pos
6,cv620,24265,15,"some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable .",pos
6,cv620,24265,16,"thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut .",pos
6,cv620,24265,17,"side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it .",pos
6,cv620,24265,18,the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian .,pos
6,cv620,24265,19,it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous .,pos
6,cv620,24265,20,"despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos .",pos
6,cv620,24265,21,the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman .,pos
6,cv620,24265,22,whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters .,pos
6,cv620,24265,23,"i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being .",pos
6,cv620,24265,24,to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger .,pos
6,cv620,24265,25,"one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker's head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film .",pos
6,cv620,24265,26,"side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don't expect to see them on the soundtrack release .",pos
6,cv620,24265,27,"huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release .",pos
6,cv620,24265,28,i'm assuming that collins requested the same .,pos
6,cv620,24265,29,"on a similar note , whitney houston's cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn't the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source .",pos
6,cv620,24265,30,"apparently , houston wasn't as open about the use of her song as the others were .",pos
6,cv620,24265,31,a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film's release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film .,pos
6,cv620,24265,32,don't look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more .,pos
6,cv620,24265,33,several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i'm still undecided .,pos
6,cv620,24265,34,"there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto .",pos
6,cv620,24265,35,"the scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) .",pos
6,cv620,24265,36,"i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) .",pos
6,cv620,24265,37,"other than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman's reality ) .",pos
6,cv620,24265,38,i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such .,pos
6,cv620,24265,39,"it may not change anyone's life , but it will certainly have an effect .",pos
6,cv620,24265,40,"i know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it .",pos

6,cv621,14368,18,"months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck .",pos
6,cv621,14368,19,"when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash .",pos
6,cv621,14368,20,"although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life .",pos
6,cv621,14368,21,"to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters .",pos
6,cv621,14368,22,this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .,pos
6,cv621,14368,23,"rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former .",pos
6,cv621,14368,24,the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all .,pos
6,cv621,14368,25,"there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots .",pos
6,cv621,14368,26,"except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table .",pos
6,cv621,14368,27,the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .,pos
6,cv621,14368,28,"we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them .",pos
6,cv621,14368,29,"matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker .",pos
6,cv621,14368,30,"ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth .",pos
6,cv621,14368,31,"john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments .",pos
6,cv621,14368,32,"he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself .",pos
6,cv621,14368,33,"martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky .",pos
6,cv621,14368,34,"while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending .",pos
6,cv621,14368,35,"perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen .",pos
6,cv621,14368,36,"she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead .",pos
6,cv621,14368,37,a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor .,pos
6,cv621,14368,38,"the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales .",pos
6,cv621,14368,39,one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .,pos
6,cv621,14368,40,""" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , "" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other .",pos
6,cv621,14368,41,i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .,pos
6,cv621,14368,42,"with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing .",pos
6,cv621,14368,43,"you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again .",pos
6,cv621,14368,44,"luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on .",pos
6,cv621,14368,45,"the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do .",pos
6,cv621,14368,46,"it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world .",pos
6,cv621,14368,47,"as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades .",pos
6,cv621,14368,48,wait !,pos
6,cv621,14368,49,"as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace .",pos

6,cv621,14368,51,"packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house .",pos
6,cv621,14368,52,"okay , i guess that's enough .",pos
6,cv621,14368,53,"oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .",pos
6,cv622,8147,0,did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ?,pos

6,cv622,8147,2,"i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey .",pos
6,cv622,8147,3,"but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions .",pos
6,cv622,8147,4,"as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth .",pos
6,cv622,8147,5,"the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars .",pos
6,cv622,8147,6,"based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed .",pos
6,cv622,8147,7,"but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast .",pos
6,cv622,8147,8,they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action .,pos
6,cv622,8147,9,and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids .,pos
6,cv622,8147,10,little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space .,pos
6,cv622,8147,11,one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious .,pos

6,cv622,8147,17,"therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners .",pos
6,cv622,8147,18,"otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key' .",pos
6,cv622,8147,19,"now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe .",pos
6,cv622,8147,20,"the mib agents on the case are "" k "" , played by tommy lee jones .",pos
6,cv622,8147,21,he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore .,pos
6,cv622,8147,22,the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes .,pos
6,cv622,8147,23,"he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , "" j "" , played by will smith .",pos
6,cv622,8147,24,"but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie .",pos
6,cv622,8147,25,"and , this isn't an independence day knockoff .",pos
6,cv622,8147,26,"rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up .",pos
6,cv622,8147,27,"but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario .",pos
6,cv622,8147,28,"yet , this movie is very appealing .",pos
6,cv622,8147,29,"the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) .",pos
6,cv622,8147,30,"it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder .",pos
6,cv622,8147,31,jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity .,pos
6,cv622,8147,32,smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones' straight man routine .,pos
6,cv622,8147,33,they click like dorothy's ruby red shoes .,pos
6,cv622,8147,34,the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam's family ) .,pos
6,cv622,8147,35,"this guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen .",pos
6,cv622,8147,36,"and , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors .",pos
6,cv622,8147,37,"the story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling !",pos
6,cv622,8147,38,"the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows .",pos

6,cv623,15356,0,"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year .",pos
6,cv623,15356,1,"from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 .",pos
6,cv623,15356,2,it is that good of a film .,pos
6,cv623,15356,3,"when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous .",pos
6,cv623,15356,4,how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ?,pos
6,cv623,15356,5,"but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about .",pos
6,cv623,15356,6,"once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer .",pos
6,cv623,15356,7,"and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special .",pos
6,cv623,15356,8,"now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding ) .",pos
6,cv623,15356,9,"the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) .",pos
6,cv623,15356,10,"forget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python's meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses .",pos
6,cv623,15356,11,"in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade .",pos
6,cv623,15356,12,"but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart .",pos
6,cv623,15356,13,"you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers .",pos
6,cv623,15356,14,they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) .,pos
6,cv623,15356,15,"they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses .",pos
6,cv623,15356,16,"it's funny , though .",pos
6,cv623,15356,17,"if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable .",pos

6,cv623,15356,26,"admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired .",pos

6,cv623,15356,28,"somehow , the farrelly's pull it off .",pos
6,cv623,15356,29,the performances here are also right on target .,pos
6,cv623,15356,30,"as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable .",pos
6,cv623,15356,31,"and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother .",pos
6,cv623,15356,32,no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here .,pos
6,cv623,15356,33,"i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february .",pos
6,cv623,15356,34,"as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way .",pos

6,cv623,15356,37,but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ?,pos

6,cv624,10744,4,"well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion .",pos
6,cv624,10744,5,"instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god .",pos
6,cv624,10744,6,"and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments .",pos
6,cv624,10744,7,instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures .,pos
6,cv624,10744,8,"when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene .",pos

6,cv624,10744,38,and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits .,pos
6,cv624,10744,39,a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film .,pos
6,cv624,10744,40,the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 .,pos
6,cv624,10744,41,it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .,pos

6,cv625,12440,3,"after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ?",pos

6,cv625,12440,8,even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase .,pos

6,cv626,7410,0,this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 .,pos
6,cv626,7410,1,"whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed .",pos
6,cv626,7410,2,the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up .,pos
6,cv626,7410,3,"someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition .",pos
6,cv626,7410,4,"now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind .",pos
6,cv626,7410,5,the plot is thus .,pos
6,cv626,7410,6,we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) .,pos
6,cv626,7410,7,the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine .,pos
6,cv626,7410,8,"requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) .",pos
6,cv626,7410,9,"but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren't speaking russian "" .",pos
6,cv626,7410,10,"meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions .",pos
6,cv626,7410,11,"this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them .",pos
6,cv626,7410,12,"the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens .",pos
6,cv626,7410,13,"the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding .",pos
6,cv626,7410,14,and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established .,pos
6,cv626,7410,15,but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss .,pos
6,cv626,7410,16,the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects .,pos
6,cv626,7410,17,"one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile .",pos
6,cv626,7410,18,"the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film's end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war .",pos
6,cv626,7410,19,"with the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story's climax is now given real weight .",pos
6,cv626,7410,20,why on earth were they left out of the original ?,pos
6,cv626,7410,21,this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible .,pos
6,cv626,7410,22,"so then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent .",pos
6,cv626,7410,23,"i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain .",pos
6,cv626,7410,24,"the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag .",pos
6,cv626,7410,25,"nonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron's greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound .",pos
6,cv627,11620,0,"i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze .",pos

6,cv627,11620,4,"it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards .",pos
6,cv627,11620,5,"criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic .",pos
6,cv627,11620,6,"wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies .",pos
6,cv627,11620,7,"i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal .",pos
6,cv627,11620,8,i imagine that this shows .,pos
6,cv627,11620,9,it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known .,pos
6,cv627,11620,10,"i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here .",pos
6,cv627,11620,11,"i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida .",pos
6,cv627,11620,12,"in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .",pos

6,cv627,11620,14,all of this happens fairly early in the film .,pos

6,cv627,11620,16,"i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked .",pos
6,cv627,11620,17,"wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks .",pos
6,cv627,11620,18,i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers .,pos
6,cv627,11620,19,i'd give the preview four stars .,pos
6,cv627,11620,20,it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since .,pos
6,cv627,11620,21,"over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong .",pos
6,cv627,11620,22,"the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets .",pos
6,cv627,11620,23,but i'm not here to talk about the preview .,pos
6,cv627,11620,24,i'm here to talk about denise richards .,pos
6,cv627,11620,25,"now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can .",pos
6,cv627,11620,26,"of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and",pos
6,cv627,11620,27,flawless body . . . but,pos
6,cv627,11620,28,"i thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) .",pos
6,cv627,11620,29,"no , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film .",pos
6,cv627,11620,30,this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future .,pos
6,cv627,11620,31,"the other actors are good , too .",pos

6,cv627,11620,34,"neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex .",pos
6,cv627,11620,35,"for a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived .",pos
6,cv627,11620,36,"that's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film .",pos
6,cv627,11620,37,"each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist .",pos

6,cv628,19325,4,review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story .,pos
6,cv628,19325,5,the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends .,pos
6,cv628,19325,6,"the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism .",pos
6,cv628,19325,7,"her mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family .",pos
6,cv628,19325,8,"he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts .",pos
6,cv628,19325,9,i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this .,pos
6,cv628,19325,10,"later , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) .",pos
6,cv628,19325,11,it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment .,pos
6,cv628,19325,12,"sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) .",pos
6,cv628,19325,13,there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks .,pos
6,cv628,19325,14,it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) .,pos

6,cv633,29837,4,"the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson .",pos
6,cv633,29837,5,the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) .,pos
6,cv633,29837,6,"in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights .",pos
6,cv633,29837,7,"although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .",pos

6,cv633,29837,9,"through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .",pos
6,cv633,29837,10,"but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .",pos
6,cv633,29837,11,"braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .",pos
6,cv633,29837,12,"however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .",pos
6,cv633,29837,13,the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .,pos
6,cv633,29837,14,"while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish .",pos
6,cv633,29837,15,"this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood .",pos
6,cv633,29837,16,"compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .",pos
6,cv633,29837,17,"braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics .",pos
6,cv633,29837,18,"what makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist .",pos
6,cv633,29837,19,"mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .",pos
6,cv633,29837,20,"wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side .",pos
6,cv633,29837,21,"naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .",pos
6,cv633,29837,22,"however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .",pos
6,cv633,29837,23,"because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be .",pos
6,cv633,29837,24,"mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .",pos
6,cv633,29837,25,"most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .",pos
6,cv633,29837,26,"brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .",pos
6,cv633,29837,27,"david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .",pos
6,cv633,29837,28,"women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .",pos
6,cv633,29837,29,"catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .",pos
6,cv633,29837,30,"from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .",pos
6,cv633,29837,31,photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .,pos
6,cv633,29837,32,"on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .",pos
6,cv633,29837,33,"although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .",pos
6,cv633,29837,34,"the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of "" longshank "" 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .",pos
6,cv633,29837,35,"he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in "" politically correct "" hollywood .",pos
6,cv633,29837,36,"to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .",pos
6,cv633,29837,37,"however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .",pos
6,cv633,29837,38,"according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .",pos
6,cv633,29837,39,this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .,pos
6,cv633,29837,40,"in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .",pos

6,cv634,11101,18,"however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson .",pos

6,cv634,11101,24,"what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind .",pos

6,cv636,15279,1,"with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about .",pos
6,cv636,15279,2,"alas , the original "" child's play "" actually isn't that bad .",pos
6,cv636,15279,3,"even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie .",pos
6,cv636,15279,4,"it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone .",pos
6,cv636,15279,5,"the premise of "" child's play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen .",pos
6,cv636,15279,6,"the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday .",pos
6,cv636,15279,7,"of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up .",pos
6,cv636,15279,8,"like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy .",pos
6,cv636,15279,9,"and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one .",pos
6,cv636,15279,10,"the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that .",pos
6,cv636,15279,11,"it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they're crazy .",pos
6,cv636,15279,12,"it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments .",pos
6,cv636,15279,13,"even if there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) ,",pos
6,cv636,15279,14,"there's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience .",pos
6,cv636,15279,15,"the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with .",pos
6,cv636,15279,16,"if there's one horrible thing about many horror films , it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , "" child's play "" steers away from that .",pos
6,cv636,15279,17,"and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look !",pos
6,cv636,15279,18,"that doll's moving on its own ! ) , but because he's a generally scary character .",pos
6,cv636,15279,19,"if there's anything really wrong with "" child's play , "" it's that it's too trite and has too less self esteem .",pos
6,cv636,15279,20,"at almost 90 minutes , "" child's play "" features way too less to be a real classic of horror .",pos
6,cv636,15279,21,it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll .,pos
6,cv636,15279,22,"if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which",pos

6,cv637,1250,11,"story : the plot was quite thin , but it really wasn't that noticeable , because of the rapid-fire jokes that myers wrote in .",pos
6,cv637,1250,12,"alot of the jokes are very similar to hot shots ! , in being very "" parodyish . """,pos
6,cv637,1250,13,"( okay , bad term . )",pos
6,cv637,1250,14,"extremely witty throughout , although ( as in hot shots ) it got a bit repetitive in the middle .",pos
6,cv637,1250,15,"acting : as in many comedies , the acting isn't really * that * important .",pos
6,cv637,1250,16,"however , myers turns in a good performance as wayne , playing the character perfectly , ( although i still liked him better back on much music , in a more "" canadian "" type of mode . )",pos
6,cv637,1250,17,"carvey is okay as garth , but he lacks the spark myers puts into wayne .",pos

6,cv644,17154,17,but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof .,pos
6,cv644,17154,18,yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story .,pos
6,cv644,17154,19,"when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights .",pos
6,cv644,17154,20,"there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror .",pos
6,cv644,17154,21,"during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can't do this , can they ? """,pos
6,cv644,17154,22,streeming through my head .,pos
6,cv644,17154,23,"in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then",pos
6,cv644,17154,24,"again , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) .",pos
6,cv644,17154,25,"instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches .",pos
6,cv644,17154,26,"most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation .",pos
6,cv644,17154,27,"his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him .",pos
6,cv644,17154,28,the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real .,pos
6,cv644,17154,29,"jacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money .",pos
6,cv644,17154,30,"the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great .",pos
6,cv644,17154,31,"i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character .",pos
6,cv644,17154,32,"thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in "" primary colors , "" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable .",pos
6,cv644,17154,33,"he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role .",pos
6,cv644,17154,34,"the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff .",pos
6,cv644,17154,35,even fonda shows off her talents nicely .,pos
6,cv644,17154,36,"and if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved .",pos
6,cv644,17154,37,"and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) .",pos
6,cv644,17154,38,"and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss .",pos
6,cv644,17154,39,"i won't reveal it , but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway .",pos
6,cv644,17154,40,"for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending .",pos
6,cv644,17154,41,"imagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it's like if in "" crime and punishment "" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i'm at all comparing "" a simple plan "" to dostoevsky .",pos
6,cv644,17154,42,"the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day .",pos
6,cv644,17154,43,"but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i've frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile .",pos
6,cv644,17154,44,at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece .,pos
6,cv645,15668,0,some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies .,pos
6,cv645,15668,1,"that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film .",pos
6,cv645,15668,2,"such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in .",pos
6,cv645,15668,3,"something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community .",pos
6,cv645,15668,4,one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california .,pos
6,cv645,15668,5,van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home .,pos
6,cv645,15668,6,"however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film .",pos
6,cv645,15668,7,"infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself .",pos
6,cv645,15668,8,"unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless .",pos
6,cv645,15668,9,"things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) .",pos
6,cv645,15668,10,"almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars .",pos
6,cv645,15668,11,"it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt .",pos
6,cv645,15668,12,"in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience .",pos
6,cv645,15668,13,"for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s .",pos
6,cv645,15668,14,on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great .,pos
6,cv645,15668,15,"but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons .",pos
6,cv645,15668,16,"the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called "" sexual revolution "" , same as all other "" revolutions "" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity .",pos
6,cv645,15668,17,"instead of being "" liberated "" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms .",pos
6,cv645,15668,18,"schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job .",pos
6,cv645,15668,19,the difference between the two is simply in the line of work .,pos
6,cv645,15668,20,many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda .,pos
6,cv645,15668,21,"on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest .",pos
6,cv645,15668,22,"in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare .",pos
6,cv645,15668,23,"the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda .",pos
6,cv645,15668,24,"van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body .",pos
6,cv645,15668,25,"on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin .",pos
6,cv645,15668,26,"even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end .",pos
6,cv645,15668,27,"unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale .",pos
6,cv645,15668,28,"the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver .",pos
6,cv645,15668,29,"apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike .",pos
6,cv645,15668,30,"but the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival .",pos
6,cv645,15668,31,"until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s .",pos
6,cv645,15668,32,"hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists .",pos
6,cv645,15668,33,"the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising .",pos
6,cv645,15668,34,"anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema .",pos
6,cv646,15065,0,"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents .",pos
6,cv646,15065,1,"and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) .",pos
6,cv646,15065,2,"but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre .",pos
6,cv646,15065,3,"and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires .",pos
6,cv646,15065,4,"there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august .",pos
6,cv646,15065,5,"the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method .",pos
6,cv646,15065,6,"( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart . )",pos
6,cv646,15065,7,"blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate .",pos
6,cv646,15065,8,"both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered .",pos
6,cv646,15065,9,"when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum .",pos
6,cv646,15065,10,"this time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) .",pos
6,cv646,15065,11,"he's a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch .",pos
6,cv646,15065,12,"he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a "" master "" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .",pos
6,cv646,15065,13,"valek kills all of jack's team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old .",pos
6,cv646,15065,14,"apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime .",pos
6,cv646,15065,15,"so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation .",pos
6,cv646,15065,16,"the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year .",pos
6,cv646,15065,17,"crow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism .",pos
6,cv646,15065,18,"baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith's bad guy .",pos
6,cv646,15065,19,"griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he's got to talk sometime .",pos
6,cv646,15065,20,"luckily , he's got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance .",pos
6,cv646,15065,21,"all said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one .",pos
6,cv646,15065,22,certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters .,pos
6,cv647,13691,0,"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia .",pos
6,cv647,13691,1,"although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones .",pos
6,cv647,13691,2,"until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters .",pos
6,cv647,13691,3,contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times .,pos
6,cv647,13691,4,"one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a .",pos
6,cv647,13691,5,"the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot .",pos
6,cv647,13691,6,"rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected .",pos

6,cv647,13691,11,"their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway .",pos
6,cv647,13691,12,"like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life .",pos
6,cv647,13691,13,"gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent .",pos
6,cv647,13691,14,"that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood .",pos
6,cv647,13691,15,secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .,pos
6,cv647,13691,16,ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie .,pos
6,cv647,13691,17,"willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable .",pos
6,cv647,13691,18,"compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers .",pos
6,cv647,13691,19,"instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end .",pos
6,cv647,13691,20,"in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) .",pos
6,cv647,13691,21,the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills .,pos
6,cv647,13691,22,"the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase .",pos
6,cv647,13691,23,"that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film .",pos

6,cv648,15792,7,insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films .,pos
6,cv648,15792,8,the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group .,pos
6,cv648,15792,9,in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction .,pos
6,cv648,15792,10,"it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line .",pos
6,cv648,15792,11,"many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat .",pos
6,cv648,15792,12,the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense .,pos
6,cv648,15792,13,"there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ?",pos
6,cv648,15792,14,the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen .,pos
6,cv648,15792,15,"so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible .",pos
6,cv648,15792,16,"but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever .",pos

6,cv649,12735,10,"all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture .",pos
6,cv649,12735,11,"thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , "" riding the wave "" of something that seemed special and important .",pos
6,cv649,12735,12,"now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it .",pos
6,cv649,12735,13,"materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the "" american dream "" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever .",pos
6,cv649,12735,14,"the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment .",pos
6,cv649,12735,15,"in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements .",pos
6,cv649,12735,16,yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance .,pos
6,cv649,12735,17,"the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations .",pos
6,cv649,12735,18,"unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo .",pos
6,cv649,12735,19,"during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either .",pos
6,cv649,12735,20,"by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner .",pos
6,cv649,12735,21,"duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change .",pos
6,cv649,12735,22,this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience .,pos
6,cv649,12735,23,"while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that .",pos
6,cv649,12735,24,"there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant .",pos
6,cv649,12735,25,"unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs .",pos
6,cv649,12735,26,"in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism .",pos
6,cv649,12735,27,"indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them .",pos

6,cv650,14340,28,"while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions .",pos

6,cv650,14340,31,"the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective .",pos

6,cv651,10492,0,"it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as "" raising arizona "" and "" the hudsucker proxy , "" made their feature film debut with "" blood simple , "" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas .",pos
6,cv651,10492,1,"it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent "" fargo , "" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; "" blood simple "" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end .",pos
6,cv651,10492,2,"the premise of "" blood simple "" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m .",pos

6,cv651,10492,4,"things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme .",pos
6,cv651,10492,5,"to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening .",pos
6,cv651,10492,6,"every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the "" big picture "" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person .",pos
6,cv651,10492,7,"this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film .",pos
6,cv651,10492,8,"the coens might have done well to title the film "" fear and loathing in texas . """,pos
6,cv651,10492,9,"some have labeled "" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else .",pos
6,cv651,10492,10,"the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive .",pos
6,cv651,10492,11,"that said , "" blood simple "" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine .",pos
6,cv651,10492,12,"the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film .",pos
6,cv651,10492,13,"that said , "" blood simple "" is not exactly flawless .",pos
6,cv651,10492,14,"for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder .",pos
6,cv651,10492,15,"and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes .",pos
6,cv651,10492,16,the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film .,pos
6,cv651,10492,17,""" blood simple "" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner .",pos

6,cv654,18246,25,"in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle .",pos

6,cv654,18246,31,"in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works .",pos
6,cv654,18246,32,"there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work .",pos
6,cv654,18246,33,"the mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these .",pos
6,cv654,18246,34,"i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them .",pos
6,cv654,18246,35,the cinematography is amazing in the mummy .,pos
6,cv654,18246,36,"particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .",pos
6,cv654,18246,37,the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography .,pos
6,cv654,18246,38,"from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch .",pos
6,cv654,18246,39,"the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .",pos
6,cv655,11154,0,"jacques tati's 1953 classic "" les vacances de m . hulot "" ( also known as "" mr . hulot's vacation , "" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film .",pos
6,cv655,11154,1,"the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation .",pos
6,cv655,11154,2,yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .,pos
6,cv655,11154,3,part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .,pos
6,cv655,11154,4,"slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .",pos
6,cv655,11154,5,"in "" les vacances de m . hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key .",pos
6,cv655,11154,6,"in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat .",pos
6,cv655,11154,7,"while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it .",pos
6,cv655,11154,8,"when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues .",pos
6,cv655,11154,9,tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .,pos
6,cv655,11154,10,"it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and "" les vacances de m . hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well .",pos
6,cv655,11154,11,tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .,pos
6,cv655,11154,12,"when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark .",pos
6,cv655,11154,13,"tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he's not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does .",pos
6,cv655,11154,14,"for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one .",pos
6,cv655,11154,15,"then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce .",pos
6,cv655,11154,16,"the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy .",pos
6,cv655,11154,17,"as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did .",pos
6,cv655,11154,18,the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .,pos
6,cv655,11154,19,"it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons .",pos
6,cv655,11154,20,"instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem .",pos
6,cv655,11154,21,""" les vacances de m . hulot "" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .",pos
6,cv655,11154,22,anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store .,pos
6,cv655,11154,23,"note : "" les vacances de m . hulot "" was not rated by the mpaa .",pos
6,cv655,11154,24,it would at most receive a pg rating .,pos
6,cv656,24201,0,i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults .,pos
6,cv656,24201,1,"the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete , as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating .",pos
6,cv656,24201,2,"however , after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571 , my bias is beginning to go away .",pos
6,cv656,24201,3,both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers .,pos
6,cv656,24201,4,"even better , i didn't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts .",pos
6,cv656,24201,5,everyone loves surprises .,pos
6,cv656,24201,6,u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets .,pos
6,cv656,24201,7,"this may be true , but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/co-writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal ; to blow the audience's socks off .",pos
6,cv656,24201,8,"set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u-boats , u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship .",pos
6,cv656,24201,9,there's only one problem : the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as ( you guessed it ) u-571 .,pos
6,cv656,24201,10,"it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors , led by an interim captain named tyler ( matthew mcconaughey ) , to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships .",pos
6,cv656,24201,11,the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors ( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear ) .,pos
6,cv656,24201,12,"once the crew gets on the u-boat , the movie shifts to another level and never leaves this high energy level until the ending credits roll down .",pos
6,cv656,24201,13,"as soon as the action starts , it does not stop and luckily , because it is so exciting , i didn't want it to stop .",pos
6,cv656,24201,14,"this is not a movie for those wanting to avoid loud noises , from the wonderful , heart-pounding score to the constant yelling of panicking men , make sure you see this at a theater with surround-sound ? otherwise , do not see it all .",pos
6,cv656,24201,15,the best parts of u-571 are when tyler is forced to make impromptu decisions on how to escape seemingly impossible situations .,pos
6,cv656,24201,16,"throughout the movie , several morals or characters are introduced to make tyler's job as stressful as possible .",pos
6,cv656,24201,17,"germans gun down their own men , tyler's mentor captain dahlgren warns him that a captain has to be prepared to sacrifice even the most beloved soldiers for a victory , another sailor ( erik palladino ) threatens mutiny .",pos
6,cv656,24201,18,"all of these examples , and several others , increase the chaotic atmosphere and the importance of tyler's every move .",pos
6,cv656,24201,19,they also make u-571 one of the most exhilarating movies i have seen in a while .,pos
6,cv657,24513,0,the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films .,pos
6,cv657,24513,1,one was _gattaca_ .,pos

6,cv657,24513,3,"just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ .",pos
6,cv657,24513,4,"however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ .",pos
6,cv657,24513,5,"a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered .",pos
6,cv657,24513,6,"his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery .",pos
6,cv657,24513,7,"along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture .",pos
6,cv657,24513,8,"_the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise .",pos
6,cv657,24513,9,the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view .,pos
6,cv657,24513,10,"first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline .",pos
6,cv657,24513,11,"second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel .",pos
6,cv657,24513,12,no wonder it fell through the cracks .,pos
6,cv657,24513,13,"done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels .",pos
6,cv657,24513,14,"many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment .",pos
6,cv657,24513,15,i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie .,pos
6,cv657,24513,16,"despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller .",pos
6,cv657,24513,17,"in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever .",pos
6,cv657,24513,18,"the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging .",pos
6,cv657,24513,19,"in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one .",pos
6,cv657,24513,20,"although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw .",pos
6,cv657,24513,21,"in fact , hannon fuller's activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane's husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters .",pos

6,cv657,24513,28,"her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times .",pos
6,cv657,24513,29,this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script .,pos
6,cv657,24513,30,"some minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places .",pos

6,cv660,21893,2,"if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action .",pos

6,cv660,21893,7,"( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood . )",pos
6,cv660,21893,8,"visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy .",pos
6,cv660,21893,9,"fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them .",pos
6,cv660,21893,10,"as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence .",pos
6,cv660,21893,11,"while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner .",pos
6,cv660,21893,12,"one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors .",pos

6,cv660,21893,16,"this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence .",pos

6,cv660,21893,20,"that this film manages to turn a box marked "" 25 cents "" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys .",pos

6,cv660,21893,25,"while that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion .",pos

6,cv660,21893,29,"here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god .",pos
6,cv660,21893,30,"in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death .",pos
6,cv660,21893,31,"significantly , the film's very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar .",pos

6,cv666,18963,14,"when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent .",pos
6,cv666,18963,15,the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace .,pos
6,cv666,18963,16,"however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him .",pos

6,cv666,18963,21,"one day , a new animal shows up : humans .",pos
6,cv666,18963,22,this is where jane comes into the picture .,pos
6,cv666,18963,23,"she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas .",pos
6,cv666,18963,24,"tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other .",pos
6,cv666,18963,25,"even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong .",pos
6,cv666,18963,26,"clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them .",pos
6,cv666,18963,27,"worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money .",pos
6,cv666,18963,28,will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ?,pos
6,cv666,18963,29,"i'm not gonna tell you , sorry .",pos
6,cv666,18963,30,you're gonna have to see for yourself .,pos
6,cv666,18963,31,"and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) .",pos
6,cv666,18963,32,the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in .,pos
6,cv666,18963,33,"in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt .",pos
6,cv666,18963,34,could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ?,pos
6,cv666,18963,35,the casting is fairly good .,pos
6,cv666,18963,36,"tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules .",pos
6,cv666,18963,37,"nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) .",pos
6,cv666,18963,38,"lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping .",pos
6,cv666,18963,39,minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane .,pos
6,cv666,18963,40,"i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her .",pos
6,cv666,18963,41,i take back my insult on driver .,pos
6,cv666,18963,42,"it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter .",pos
6,cv666,18963,43,"on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton .",pos
6,cv666,18963,44,"he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly .",pos
6,cv666,18963,45,"but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk .",pos
6,cv666,18963,46,"she also has a fiesty attitude ( "" i'm gonna kill ya ! """,pos
6,cv666,18963,47,"she says , more than once ) .",pos
6,cv666,18963,48,"i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting "" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah "" .",pos
6,cv666,18963,49,"i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer .",pos
6,cv666,18963,50,"not that she was the only funny character in the film , though .",pos
6,cv666,18963,51,"wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "" un-sanitary "" water .",pos
6,cv666,18963,52,"( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) .",pos
6,cv666,18963,53,"the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins .",pos
6,cv666,18963,54,"this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing .",pos
6,cv666,18963,55,"i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace .",pos
6,cv666,18963,56,"the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules .",pos
6,cv666,18963,57,"if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of "" trashing the camp "" from the film .",pos
6,cv666,18963,58,"i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be .",pos
6,cv666,18963,59,"i was upset that it wasn't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan .",pos
6,cv666,18963,60,"oh , well . . .",pos
6,cv666,18963,61,"overall , i was enthralled with tarzan .",pos
6,cv666,18963,62,"i wouldn't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney's greatest achievements .",pos
6,cv666,18963,63,"i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough's tarzan .",pos
6,cv667,18467,0,"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo .",pos

6,cv667,18467,2,"however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade .",pos

6,cv667,18467,4,"it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time .",pos
6,cv667,18467,5,"we're the fans , not the freaks .",pos
6,cv667,18467,6,"we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down .",pos
6,cv667,18467,7,"all right , stop looking at me like that .",pos
6,cv667,18467,8,we have been faithfully and patiently waiting .,pos
6,cv667,18467,9,waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll .,pos
6,cv667,18467,10,"you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah .",pos
6,cv667,18467,11,"unfortunately , it is not our savior .",pos
6,cv667,18467,12,"for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good .",pos
6,cv667,18467,13,anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century .,pos
6,cv667,18467,14,"i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking .",pos
6,cv667,18467,15,character development is virtually nonexistent .,pos
6,cv667,18467,16,"with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions .",pos
6,cv667,18467,17,"none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all .",pos
6,cv667,18467,18,"contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala .",pos
6,cv667,18467,19,"jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) .",pos
6,cv667,18467,20,"his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting .",pos
6,cv667,18467,21,"his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport .",pos
6,cv667,18467,22,therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors .,pos
6,cv667,18467,23,"in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy . """,pos
6,cv667,18467,24,"in the phantom menace , we get doo doo .",pos
6,cv667,18467,25,"the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . """,pos
6,cv667,18467,26,"this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience .",pos
6,cv667,18467,27,"perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play .",pos
6,cv667,18467,28,"i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ?",pos
6,cv667,18467,29,the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction .,pos
6,cv667,18467,30,"this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me .",pos
6,cv667,18467,31,"i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ?",pos
6,cv667,18467,32,didn't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ?,pos
6,cv667,18467,33,didn't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ?,pos
6,cv667,18467,34,"of course they did , and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults .",pos
6,cv667,18467,35,"one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects .",pos
6,cv667,18467,36,"the people at lucas's industrial light and magic , the world's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage .",pos
6,cv667,18467,37,"some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation's robot army and jar jar's countrymen .",pos
6,cv667,18467,38,"the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer .",pos
6,cv667,18467,39,"this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today .",pos
6,cv667,18467,40,"john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can .",pos
6,cv667,18467,41,"his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately .",pos
6,cv667,18467,42,"since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar .",pos
6,cv667,18467,43,"as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin .",pos
6,cv667,18467,44,"it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films .",pos
6,cv667,18467,45,"one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film's release .",pos
6,cv667,18467,46,"in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn't have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant .",pos
6,cv667,18467,47,"he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean .",pos
6,cv667,18467,48,"with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment .",pos
6,cv667,18467,49,"lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout .",pos
6,cv667,18467,50,"however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection .",pos
6,cv667,18467,51,"oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body's cells .",pos
6,cv667,18467,52,this only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection .,pos
6,cv667,18467,53,don't let me mislead you too far .,pos
6,cv667,18467,54,"the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film .",pos
6,cv667,18467,55,"it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends .",pos
6,cv667,18467,56,"it's just that when held up to it's predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales .",pos
6,cv668,17604,0,"in december of 1996 , a little movie called "" scream , "" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens .",pos

6,cv668,17604,12,"as you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) .",pos
6,cv668,17604,13,"at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she's all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you're vapor "" ) .",pos
6,cv668,17604,14,"since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained .",pos

6,cv668,17604,28,""" 10 things i hate about you "" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s .",pos

6,cv670,25826,11,a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs .,pos

6,cv674,10732,6,"the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance .",pos
6,cv674,10732,7,"these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red .",pos
6,cv674,10732,8,"however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life .",pos

6,cv677,17715,16,"it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some "" healthy "" immorality is not a world at all .",pos
6,cv677,17715,17,"instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right .",pos
6,cv677,17715,18,"there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story .",pos

6,cv678,13419,1,be forewarned .,pos
6,cv678,13419,2,"east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films .",pos
6,cv678,13419,3,"an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential .",pos
6,cv678,13419,4,though not for lack of trying .,pos
6,cv678,13419,5,"in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat .",pos
6,cv678,13419,6,"the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ?",pos
6,cv678,13419,7,"in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending .",pos
6,cv678,13419,8,"the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) .",pos
6,cv678,13419,9,"dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence .",pos
6,cv678,13419,10,"while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory .",pos
6,cv678,13419,11,"the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land .",pos
6,cv678,13419,12,"at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage .",pos
6,cv678,13419,13,"as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity .",pos
6,cv678,13419,14,"scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation .",pos
6,cv678,13419,15,"mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour .",pos
6,cv678,13419,16,"it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry .",pos
6,cv678,13419,17,"off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief .",pos
6,cv678,13419,18,"they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity .",pos
6,cv678,13419,19,"at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang .",pos
6,cv678,13419,20,"everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film .",pos
6,cv678,13419,21,"the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation .",pos
6,cv678,13419,22,"another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness .",pos
6,cv678,13419,23,"composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- "" i'll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable .",pos
6,cv678,13419,24,"only "" reflections "" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices .",pos
6,cv678,13419,25,"nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive .",pos
6,cv678,13419,26,"while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable .",pos

6,cv683,12167,2,its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before .,pos

6,cv683,12167,5,"because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself .",pos
6,cv683,12167,6,"the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby .",pos

6,cv683,12167,8,"he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role .",pos
6,cv683,12167,9,he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck .,pos
6,cv683,12167,10,"for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film .",pos
6,cv683,12167,11,he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling .,pos

6,cv683,12167,16,"acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death .",pos
6,cv683,12167,17,the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .,pos
6,cv683,12167,18,"although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked .",pos
6,cv683,12167,19,van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .,pos
6,cv683,12167,20,"at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . .

6,cv683,12167,21,"van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration .",pos
6,cv683,12167,22,"of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary .",pos
6,cv683,12167,23,it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .,pos
6,cv683,12167,24,"at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it .",pos
6,cv683,12167,25,"distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . """,pos
6,cv683,12167,26,"of course , once it caught on , it caught on big .",pos
6,cv683,12167,27,""" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .",pos

6,cv683,12167,30,"when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it .",pos
6,cv683,12167,31,there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .,pos
6,cv683,12167,32,"others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives .",pos
6,cv683,12167,33,"still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm .",pos
6,cv683,12167,34,"nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view .",pos
6,cv683,12167,35,"it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before .",pos
6,cv683,12167,36,"until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites .",pos
6,cv683,12167,37,"the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" ) .",pos
6,cv683,12167,38,"van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it .",pos
6,cv683,12167,39,"when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman .",pos
6,cv683,12167,40,"near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die .",pos

6,cv683,12167,42,"let him die on his own . """,pos
6,cv683,12167,43,"it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape .",pos
6,cv683,12167,44,"and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out !",pos

6,cv683,12167,46,"beyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be .",pos
6,cv683,12167,47,"he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time .",pos

6,cv683,12167,49,"he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .",pos
6,cv683,12167,50,"the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment .",pos

6,cv683,12167,54,"the legacy of "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .",pos

6,cv684,11798,17,give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements .,pos
6,cv684,11798,18,"there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements .",pos
6,cv684,11798,19,"it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks .",pos
6,cv684,11798,20,"proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) .",pos
6,cv684,11798,21,the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay .,pos
6,cv684,11798,22,"second , the editing of the film is good .",pos
6,cv684,11798,23,"the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the "" amnesia "" explained , in satisfying increments .",pos
6,cv684,11798,24,"also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look .",pos
6,cv684,11798,25,"third , the special effects are well used .",pos
6,cv684,11798,26,"they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job .",pos
6,cv684,11798,27,one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically .,pos

6,cv684,11798,29,"a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous .",pos
6,cv684,11798,30,"restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive .",pos
6,cv684,11798,31,"finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance .",pos

6,cv689,12587,8,"while parts of "" the horse whisperer "" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial "" travelogue "" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast .",pos

6,cv692,15451,55,"whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" ) .",pos
6,cv692,15451,56,"having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise .",pos
6,cv692,15451,57,"the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original .",pos
6,cv692,15451,58,"missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life .",pos
6,cv692,15451,59,""" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable .",pos
6,cv692,15451,60,""" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones .",pos
6,cv692,15451,61,"this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on .",pos
6,cv692,15451,62,"but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive .",pos
6,cv692,15451,63,""" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe .",pos
6,cv692,15451,64,"hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality .",pos
6,cv692,15451,65,"best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique .",pos
6,cv692,15451,66,"it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not .",pos
6,cv692,15451,67,"please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one .",pos
6,cv692,15451,68,"but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best .",pos
6,cv692,15451,69,"as an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end .",pos
6,cv692,15451,70,"sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness .",pos
6,cv692,15451,71,"it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation .",pos
6,cv692,15451,72,""" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema .",pos
6,cv692,15451,73,"as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .",pos
6,cv693,18063,0,let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal .,pos
6,cv693,18063,1,so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal .,pos
6,cv693,18063,2,i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times .,pos
6,cv693,18063,3,"under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix .",pos
6,cv693,18063,4,"this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet .",pos
6,cv693,18063,5,the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age .,pos
6,cv693,18063,6,"in other words , the sound sucked .",pos
6,cv693,18063,7,"as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film .",pos
6,cv693,18063,8,i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together .,pos
6,cv693,18063,9,"there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review .",pos
6,cv693,18063,10,"which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing .",pos
6,cv693,18063,11,my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix .,pos
6,cv693,18063,12,it is nothing short of stunning visually .,pos
6,cv693,18063,13,"sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good .",pos
6,cv693,18063,14,"the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked .",pos
6,cv693,18063,15,keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax .,pos
6,cv693,18063,16,it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster .,pos
6,cv693,18063,17,"now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network .",pos
6,cv693,18063,18,the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed .,pos
6,cv693,18063,19,the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose .,pos
6,cv693,18063,20,that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons .,pos
6,cv693,18063,21,they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie .,pos
6,cv693,18063,22,"reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .",pos
6,cv693,18063,23,"newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters .",pos
6,cv693,18063,24,the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular .,pos
6,cv693,18063,25,this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts .,pos
6,cv693,18063,26,this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film .,pos
6,cv693,18063,27,"when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful .",pos
6,cv693,18063,28,"as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film .",pos
6,cv693,18063,29,"acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either .",pos
6,cv693,18063,30,keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances .,pos
6,cv693,18063,31,"although to his credit , it is one of his better performances .",pos
6,cv693,18063,32,laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film .,pos
6,cv693,18063,33,more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama .,pos
6,cv693,18063,34,joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had .,pos
6,cv693,18063,35,carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role .,pos
6,cv693,18063,36,it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks .,pos
6,cv693,18063,37,you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film .,pos
6,cv693,18063,38,it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences .,pos
6,cv693,18063,39,"i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times .",pos
6,cv693,18063,40,in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird .,pos
6,cv693,18063,41,it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie .,pos
6,cv693,18063,42,so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about .,pos
6,cv693,18063,43,thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability .,pos
6,cv693,18063,44,my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending .,pos
6,cv693,18063,45,the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before .,pos
6,cv693,18063,46,the ending itself was just plain strange .,pos
6,cv693,18063,47,the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch .,pos
6,cv693,18063,48,"while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening .",pos
6,cv694,4876,0,alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .,pos
6,cv694,4876,1,"kieslowski's blue , that is .",pos
6,cv694,4876,2,"with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release .",pos
6,cv694,4876,3,"language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length .",pos
6,cv694,4876,4,"as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant .",pos
6,cv694,4876,5,"alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" .",pos
6,cv694,4876,6,"while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) .",pos
6,cv694,4876,7,"when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her .",pos
6,cv694,4876,8,"following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil .",pos
6,cv694,4876,9,"events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability .",pos
6,cv694,4876,10,"in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult .",pos
6,cv694,4876,11,alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .,pos
6,cv694,4876,12,"in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art .",pos
6,cv694,4876,13,does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?,pos
6,cv694,4876,14,"are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ?",pos
6,cv694,4876,15,"myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context .",pos
6,cv694,4876,16,"through louisa's struggles , she succeeds .",pos
6,cv694,4876,17,"while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination .",pos
6,cv694,4876,18,"even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention .",pos
6,cv694,4876,19,the cinematography is stunning .,pos
6,cv694,4876,20,"city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions .",pos
6,cv694,4876,21,"later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground .",pos
6,cv694,4876,22,it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .,pos
6,cv694,4876,23,"the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul .",pos
6,cv694,4876,24,"and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace .",pos
6,cv694,4876,25,her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal .,pos
6,cv694,4876,26,"even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch .",pos
6,cv694,4876,27,"alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close .",pos
6,cv695,21108,0,who would have thought ?,pos
6,cv695,21108,1,jim carrey does drama .,pos
6,cv695,21108,2,"when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! """,pos
6,cv695,21108,3,"however , it was an even better premise for a drama .",pos
6,cv695,21108,4,the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .,pos
6,cv695,21108,5,that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .,pos
6,cv695,21108,6,"truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way .",pos
6,cv695,21108,7,"christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world .",pos
6,cv695,21108,8,he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .,pos
6,cv695,21108,9,"there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal .",pos
6,cv695,21108,10,the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world .,pos
6,cv695,21108,11,"we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past .",pos
6,cv695,21108,12,"it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start .",pos
6,cv695,21108,13,the film can be described in one word : weird .,pos
6,cv695,21108,14,"it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did .",pos
6,cv695,21108,15,"it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it .",pos
6,cv695,21108,16,jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .,pos
6,cv695,21108,17,"the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama .",pos
6,cv695,21108,18,"no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey .",pos
6,cv695,21108,19,and he showed them all up .,pos
6,cv695,21108,20,jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .,pos
6,cv695,21108,21,"i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination .",pos
6,cv695,21108,22,"he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .",pos
6,cv695,21108,23,"he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening .",pos
6,cv695,21108,24,he ventures into the wrong elevator .,pos
6,cv695,21108,25,a light crashes in front of him .,pos
6,cv695,21108,26,his father comes back and is then pulled away .,pos
6,cv695,21108,27,"we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not .",pos
6,cv695,21108,28,and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .,pos
6,cv695,21108,29,carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .,pos
6,cv695,21108,30,laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife .,pos
6,cv695,21108,31,she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .,pos
6,cv695,21108,32,"peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape .",pos
6,cv695,21108,33,the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .,pos
6,cv695,21108,34,"despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman's world .",pos
6,cv695,21108,35,"he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created .",pos
6,cv695,21108,36,he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .,pos
6,cv695,21108,37,"the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish .",pos
6,cv695,21108,38,"but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show .",pos
6,cv695,21108,39,it really makes you think .,pos
6,cv695,21108,40,"maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show .",pos
6,cv695,21108,41,some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .,pos
6,cv695,21108,42,or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival .,pos
6,cv695,21108,43,and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .,pos
6,cv695,21108,44,all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .,pos
6,cv695,21108,45,"i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .",pos
6,cv695,21108,46,"overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood .",pos
6,cv695,21108,47,"jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best .",pos
6,cv695,21108,48,andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .,pos
6,cv695,21108,49,the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .,pos
6,cv696,29740,0,"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp .",pos
6,cv696,29740,1,to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity .,pos

6,cv696,29740,3,", +3 ( -4 to +4 )",pos
6,cv696,29740,4,more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .,pos
6,cv696,29740,5,this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law .,pos
6,cv696,29740,6,"during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war .",pos
6,cv696,29740,7,this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .,pos
6,cv696,29740,8,"when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal .",pos
6,cv696,29740,9,minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output .,pos
6,cv696,29740,10,"while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% .",pos
6,cv696,29740,11,the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad .,pos
6,cv696,29740,12,that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do .,pos
6,cv696,29740,13,the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day .,pos
6,cv696,29740,14,and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll .,pos
6,cv696,29740,15,in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany .,pos
6,cv696,29740,16,"filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese .",pos
6,cv696,29740,17,there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps .,pos
6,cv696,29740,18,certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai .,pos
6,cv696,29740,19,there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it .,pos
6,cv696,29740,20,"then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . """,pos
6,cv696,29740,21,lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa .,pos
6,cv696,29740,22,it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university .,pos
6,cv696,29740,23,the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them .,pos
6,cv696,29740,24,the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad .,pos
6,cv696,29740,25,"it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves .",pos
6,cv696,29740,26,beating and torture are commonplace events .,pos
6,cv696,29740,27,men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable .,pos
6,cv696,29740,28,"however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house .",pos
6,cv696,29740,29,so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine .,pos
6,cv696,29740,30,this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies .,pos
6,cv696,29740,31,"the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning .",pos
6,cv696,29740,32,conformity is purpose .,pos
6,cv696,29740,33,before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp .,pos
6,cv696,29740,34,if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story .,pos
6,cv696,29740,35,"if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story .",pos
6,cv696,29740,36,it is neither .,pos
6,cv696,29740,37,it is a stirring and believable account of camp life .,pos
6,cv696,29740,38,the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow .,pos
6,cv696,29740,39,this serves a double purpose for cunningham .,pos
6,cv696,29740,40,it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat .,pos
6,cv696,29740,41,it also creates a distancing effect .,pos
6,cv696,29740,42,the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music .,pos
6,cv696,29740,43,this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience .,pos
6,cv696,29740,44,i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .,pos
6,cv697,11162,0,"another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun .",pos

6,cv697,11162,2,"the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives .",pos
6,cv697,11162,3,and all of this is great fun .,pos
6,cv697,11162,4,"swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment .",pos
6,cv697,11162,5,"no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors .",pos
6,cv697,11162,6,"the script , by favreau , is great .",pos
6,cv697,11162,7,"mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex .",pos
6,cv697,11162,8,"the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script .",pos
6,cv697,11162,9,"vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl .",pos
6,cv697,11162,10,"some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature .",pos
6,cv697,11162,11,"vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner .",pos
6,cv697,11162,12,"the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . )",pos
6,cv697,11162,13,"there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence .",pos
6,cv697,11162,14,"embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . )",pos
6,cv697,11162,15,"mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them .",pos
6,cv697,11162,16,"although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends .",pos
6,cv697,11162,17,they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background .,pos
6,cv697,11162,18,"but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts .",pos
6,cv697,11162,19,it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles .,pos
6,cv697,11162,20,the acting is superb .,pos
6,cv697,11162,21,"as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film .",pos
6,cv697,11162,22,"favreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny .",pos
6,cv697,11162,23,"graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with .",pos
6,cv697,11162,24,"she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience .",pos
6,cv697,11162,25,"swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws .",pos
6,cv697,11162,26,"firstly , the running time is a bit too short .",pos
6,cv697,11162,27,"the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer .",pos
6,cv697,11162,28,"it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long !",pos
6,cv697,11162,29,"also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) .",pos
6,cv697,11162,30,"but these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy .",pos
6,cv698,15253,0,a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal .,pos
6,cv698,15253,1,a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another .,pos
6,cv698,15253,2,a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain .,pos
6,cv698,15253,3,a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end .,pos
6,cv698,15253,4,"if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues .",pos
6,cv698,15253,5,"it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label .",pos
6,cv698,15253,6,edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states .,pos
6,cv698,15253,7,you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines .,pos
6,cv698,15253,8,"arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack .",pos
6,cv698,15253,9,"however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal .",pos
6,cv698,15253,10,"in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world .",pos
6,cv698,15253,11,"unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza .",pos
6,cv698,15253,12,"while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information .",pos
6,cv698,15253,13,"generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm .",pos
6,cv698,15253,14,even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country .,pos
6,cv698,15253,15,"hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government .",pos
6,cv698,15253,16,"the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . """,pos
6,cv698,15253,17,"however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare .",pos
6,cv698,15253,18,"revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america .",pos
6,cv698,15253,19,"admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid .",pos
6,cv698,15253,20,i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order .,pos
6,cv698,15253,21,"it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself .",pos
6,cv698,15253,22,"in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk .",pos
6,cv698,15253,23,"although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups .",pos
6,cv698,15253,24,"throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully .",pos
6,cv698,15253,25,"what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides .",pos
6,cv698,15253,26,"it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience .",pos
6,cv698,15253,27,"i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great .",pos
6,cv698,15253,28,"this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable .",pos
6,cv698,15253,29,"annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable .",pos
6,cv698,15253,30,"it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range .",pos
6,cv698,15253,31,"bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face .",pos
6,cv698,15253,32,"however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development .",pos
6,cv698,15253,33,"notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant .",pos
6,cv698,15253,34,"the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society .",pos
6,cv698,15253,35,"difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch .",pos
6,cv698,15253,36,"perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night .",pos
6,cv698,15253,37,"whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer .",pos
6,cv698,15253,38,"i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most .",pos
6,cv698,15253,39,revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole .,pos
6,cv698,15253,40,it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year .,pos
6,cv698,15253,41,missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes .,pos
6,cv698,15253,42,"for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick .",pos
6,cv698,15253,43,"unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching .",pos
6,cv698,15253,44,"in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops .",pos
6,cv698,15253,45,verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point .,pos
6,cv698,15253,46,"the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along .",pos
6,cv698,15253,47,"a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously .",pos
6,cv698,15253,48,"these flaws are glaring , but they don't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .",pos
6,cv699,7223,0,very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) .,pos
6,cv699,7223,1,they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind .,pos
6,cv699,7223,2,"you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch .",pos
6,cv699,7223,3,"in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others .",pos
6,cv699,7223,4,"beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones .",pos
6,cv699,7223,5,they live their lives in front of the television .,pos
6,cv699,7223,6,the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen .,pos
6,cv699,7223,7,"this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone .",pos
6,cv699,7223,8,"beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there .",pos
6,cv699,7223,9,the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television .,pos
6,cv699,7223,10,even at this point they have no idea what has happened .,pos
6,cv699,7223,11,"they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television .",pos
6,cv699,7223,12,"before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid .",pos
6,cv699,7223,13,this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film .,pos
6,cv699,7223,14,"eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television .",pos
6,cv699,7223,15,luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife .,pos
6,cv699,7223,16,"this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife "" .",pos
6,cv699,7223,17,"beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife .",pos
6,cv699,7223,18,"they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" .",pos
6,cv699,7223,19,"to them , this is the best day of their lives .",pos
6,cv699,7223,20,"not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv .",pos
6,cv699,7223,21,"inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi .",pos
6,cv699,7223,22,"oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds .",pos
6,cv699,7223,23,"they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc .",pos
6,cv699,7223,24,"the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it .",pos
6,cv699,7223,25,at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself .,pos
6,cv699,7223,26,beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives .,pos
6,cv699,7223,27,they even get to meet the president .,pos
6,cv699,7223,28,"but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity .",pos
6,cv699,7223,29,"this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them .",pos
6,cv699,7223,30,"the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude .",pos
6,cv699,7223,31,"in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television .",pos
6,cv699,7223,32,"in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society .",pos
6,cv699,7223,33,"if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear .",pos
6,cv699,7223,34,"otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through .",pos
6,cv699,7223,35,one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll,pos
6,cv699,7223,36,never hear the end of it !,pos
7,cv700,21947,0,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films .",pos
7,cv700,21947,1,i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years .,pos
7,cv700,21947,2,i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film .,pos
7,cv700,21947,3,"by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance .",pos
7,cv700,21947,4,all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience .,pos
7,cv700,21947,5,it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts .,pos
7,cv700,21947,6,it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in .,pos
7,cv700,21947,7,"i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain .",pos
7,cv700,21947,8,"anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond .",pos
7,cv700,21947,9,"i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films .",pos
7,cv700,21947,10,there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined .,pos
7,cv700,21947,11,and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series .,pos
7,cv700,21947,12,the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series .,pos
7,cv700,21947,13,everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 .,pos
7,cv700,21947,14,"for the most part , the action sequences worked very well .",pos
7,cv700,21947,15,"although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film .",pos
7,cv700,21947,16,i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted .,pos
7,cv700,21947,17,"while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film .",pos
7,cv700,21947,18,most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie .,pos
7,cv700,21947,19,he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing .,pos
7,cv700,21947,20,but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing .,pos
7,cv700,21947,21,"if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit .",pos
7,cv700,21947,22,the world is not enough is no exception .,pos
7,cv700,21947,23,this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world .,pos
7,cv700,21947,24,"007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain .",pos
7,cv700,21947,25,why this point is included is beyond me .,pos
7,cv700,21947,26,"they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought .",pos
7,cv700,21947,27,"anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline .",pos
7,cv700,21947,28,i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore .,pos
7,cv700,21947,29,"bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims .",pos
7,cv700,21947,30,"along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) .",pos
7,cv700,21947,31,"like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words .",pos
7,cv700,21947,32,my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films .,pos
7,cv700,21947,33,there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing .,pos
7,cv700,21947,34,the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character .,pos
7,cv700,21947,35,it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film .,pos
7,cv700,21947,36,"later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something .",pos
7,cv700,21947,37,"but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly .",pos
7,cv700,21947,38,"after all , it isn't shakespeare .",pos
7,cv700,21947,39,how about the cast ?,pos
7,cv700,21947,40,brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 .,pos
7,cv700,21947,41,"i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character .",pos
7,cv700,21947,42,"judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role .",pos
7,cv700,21947,43,she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner .,pos
7,cv700,21947,44,"robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie .",pos
7,cv700,21947,45,"coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes .",pos
7,cv700,21947,46,then there are the bond girls .,pos
7,cv700,21947,47,sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today .,pos
7,cv700,21947,48,there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim .,pos
7,cv700,21947,49,those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face .,pos
7,cv700,21947,50,marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest .,pos
7,cv700,21947,51,then we have denise richards .,pos
7,cv700,21947,52,there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks .,pos
7,cv700,21947,53,"and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes .",pos
7,cv700,21947,54,i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist .,pos
7,cv700,21947,55,"admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely .",pos
7,cv700,21947,56,i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character .,pos
7,cv700,21947,57,"while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me .",pos
7,cv700,21947,58,"the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground .",pos
7,cv700,21947,59,"i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character .",pos
7,cv700,21947,60,"this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations .",pos
7,cv700,21947,61,"last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever .",pos

7,cv701,14252,5,one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .,pos
7,cv701,14252,6,"firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .",pos

7,cv701,14252,34,"she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another .",pos

7,cv707,10678,7,3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart .,pos
7,cv707,10678,8,4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 .,pos

7,cv707,10678,11,7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited .,pos
7,cv707,10678,12,"8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so .",pos
7,cv707,10678,13,9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years .,pos
7,cv707,10678,14,"10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so .",pos
7,cv707,10678,15,"11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song .",pos
7,cv707,10678,16,"since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill . ' """,pos
7,cv707,10678,17,and in some ways it is .,pos
7,cv707,10678,18,"both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships .",pos
7,cv707,10678,19,"but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant .",pos
7,cv707,10678,20,"the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) .",pos

7,cv707,10678,33,"that's really what makes "" peter's friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another .",pos
7,cv707,10678,34,"it's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends .",pos
7,cv707,10678,35,"not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s .",pos
7,cv707,10678,36,"there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears "" everybody wants to rule the world , "" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old "" come on eileen "" ) , but this is the british 80s we're talking about .",pos

7,cv707,10678,41,"the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter's mansion .",pos
7,cv707,10678,42,"a little note should be made about hugh laurie's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i've never seen him actually act this dramatically .",pos

7,cv710,22577,0,"`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance .",pos
7,cv710,22577,1,"for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers .",pos
7,cv710,22577,2,"lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer .",pos
7,cv710,22577,3,"but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal .",pos
7,cv710,22577,4,"in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered .",pos
7,cv710,22577,5,"`run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways .",pos
7,cv710,22577,6,"in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack .",pos
7,cv710,22577,7,"`lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go .",pos
7,cv710,22577,8,"tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout .",pos
7,cv710,22577,9,"with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year .",pos
7,cv710,22577,10,even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period .,pos
7,cv710,22577,11,"as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma .",pos
7,cv710,22577,12,her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star .,pos
7,cv710,22577,13,"meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life .",pos
7,cv710,22577,14,both actors perform beyond the call of duty .,pos
7,cv710,22577,15,"the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected .",pos
7,cv710,22577,16,"the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time .",pos
7,cv710,22577,17,"additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance .",pos
7,cv710,22577,18,"`run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast .",pos
7,cv710,22577,19,this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching .,pos
7,cv710,22577,20,the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation .,pos
7,cv710,22577,21,"most are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any .",pos
7,cv710,22577,22,"but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay .",pos
7,cv710,22577,23,"a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality .",pos
7,cv710,22577,24,"most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies .",pos
7,cv710,22577,25,perhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries .,pos

7,cv711,11665,0,"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living .",pos
7,cv711,11665,1,"he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings .",pos
7,cv711,11665,2,"on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks .",pos

7,cv711,11665,5,"they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle .",pos
7,cv711,11665,6,"alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility .",pos

7,cv711,11665,8,"the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it .",pos
7,cv711,11665,9,"however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through .",pos

7,cv711,11665,11,"and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money .",pos
7,cv711,11665,12,"however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money .",pos
7,cv711,11665,13,"he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents .",pos
7,cv711,11665,14,"he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner .",pos
7,cv711,11665,15,"his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years .",pos

7,cv711,11665,18,"in his mind , his daughter is dead .",pos
7,cv711,11665,19,"the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own .",pos
7,cv711,11665,20,"however , not everyone in town wants it to happen .",pos
7,cv711,11665,21,"billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it .",pos
7,cv711,11665,22,"he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman .",pos
7,cv711,11665,23,"he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds .",pos
7,cv711,11665,24,"to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way .",pos
7,cv711,11665,25,"central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it .",pos
7,cv711,11665,26,"aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out .",pos
7,cv711,11665,27,"it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled .",pos
7,cv711,11665,28,"obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck .",pos
7,cv711,11665,29,"her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) .",pos

7,cv711,11665,31,"of all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film .",pos
7,cv711,11665,32,egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up .,pos
7,cv711,11665,33,"what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous .",pos
7,cv711,11665,34,"in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life .",pos
7,cv711,11665,35,"egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold .",pos
7,cv711,11665,36,""" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy .",pos
7,cv711,11665,37,""" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked .",pos
7,cv711,11665,38,"the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind .",pos
7,cv711,11665,39,"the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements .",pos
7,cv711,11665,40,"like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole .",pos
7,cv711,11665,41,"he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease .",pos
7,cv711,11665,42,"the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight .",pos
7,cv711,11665,43,"because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms .",pos
7,cv711,11665,44,"certainly one of the best films of 1997 , "" the sweet hereafter "" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film .",pos
7,cv712,22920,0,"when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies .",pos
7,cv712,22920,1,"from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc . ) .",pos
7,cv712,22920,2,"when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie .",pos
7,cv712,22920,3,how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies .,pos
7,cv712,22920,4,"was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ?",pos
7,cv712,22920,5,it just seemed cheap to me .,pos
7,cv712,22920,6,"then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude .",pos
7,cv712,22920,7,"scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie .",pos
7,cv712,22920,8,"if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen .",pos
7,cv712,22920,9,this is part of the fun of watching scream .,pos
7,cv712,22920,10,"the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers .",pos
7,cv712,22920,11,"to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film .",pos
7,cv712,22920,12,there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though .,pos
7,cv712,22920,13,"i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics .",pos
7,cv712,22920,14,their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive .,pos
7,cv712,22920,15,"from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories .",pos
7,cv712,22920,16,"films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream .",pos
7,cv712,22920,17,"the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's .",pos
7,cv712,22920,18,"this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors .",pos
7,cv712,22920,19,scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson .,pos
7,cv712,22920,20,"within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie .",pos
7,cv712,22920,21,"mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat ) .",pos
7,cv712,22920,22,not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors .,pos
7,cv712,22920,23,the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction .,pos
7,cv712,22920,24,"in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement .",pos
7,cv712,22920,25,"i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies .",pos
7,cv712,22920,26,i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream's perfect subtlety .,pos

7,cv728,16133,7,"joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) .",pos

7,cv728,16133,15,"shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter .",pos
7,cv728,16133,16,"i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care .",pos

7,cv728,16133,27,"stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time .",pos
7,cv728,16133,28,"there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub .",pos

7,cv731,4136,27,"one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a "" psycho , "" with no motives behind his slayings .",pos

7,cv731,4136,33,"really , seven doesn't just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is .",pos
7,cv731,4136,34,"seven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does .",pos
7,cv731,4136,35,"besides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller .",pos
7,cv731,4136,36,"it features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair .",pos

7,cv733,9839,7,"one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete .",pos

7,cv733,9839,14,"as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door .",pos
7,cv733,9839,15,boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . 's hardcore film scene .,pos
7,cv733,9839,16,but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends .,pos
7,cv733,9839,17,the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut .,pos
7,cv733,9839,18,"by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams .",pos
7,cv733,9839,19,boogie nights is not about sex .,pos
7,cv733,9839,20,it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers .,pos
7,cv733,9839,21,"in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all .",pos
7,cv733,9839,22,pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are .,pos
7,cv733,9839,23,"the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world .",pos
7,cv733,9839,24,"yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively .",pos

7,cv733,9839,28,but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams .,pos
7,cv733,9839,29,eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it .,pos
7,cv733,9839,30,"with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame .",pos

7,cv733,9839,33,"the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes .",pos
7,cv733,9839,34,"clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children .",pos
7,cv733,9839,35,"but the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to .",pos
7,cv733,9839,36,even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family .,pos
7,cv733,9839,37,"then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all .",pos
7,cv733,9839,38,"eddie adams , who later takes on the screen name "" dirk diggler "" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg .",pos
7,cv733,9839,39,"i say "" former "" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job .",pos
7,cv733,9839,40,this is bold and brave territory for such a young man .,pos

7,cv733,9839,45,wahlberg's surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson's .,pos
7,cv733,9839,46,"but in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year .",pos
7,cv733,9839,47,i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance .,pos
7,cv733,9839,48,"still , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya",pos

7,cv734,21568,0,"i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality .",pos
7,cv734,21568,1,"but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations .",pos
7,cv734,21568,2,it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation .,pos
7,cv734,21568,3,"in addition , it's also a terrific family film .",pos
7,cv734,21568,4,"this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools .",pos

7,cv734,21568,8,"out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view .",pos
7,cv734,21568,9,"she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ?",pos
7,cv734,21568,10,"slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied .",pos
7,cv734,21568,11,one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven .,pos
7,cv734,21568,12,"after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama .",pos
7,cv734,21568,13,"at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material .",pos

7,cv734,21568,16,the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate .,pos
7,cv734,21568,17,"yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work .",pos
7,cv734,21568,18,"angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience .",pos

7,cv734,21568,22,the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin .,pos
7,cv734,21568,23,"there's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman .",pos

7,cv734,21568,26,"it's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal .",pos

7,cv736,23670,18,"`final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong .",pos

7,cv738,10116,0,here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park .,pos
7,cv738,10116,1,"in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) .",pos

7,cv738,10116,4,"now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity .",pos
7,cv738,10116,5,that film is amistad .,pos
7,cv738,10116,6,"although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture .",pos
7,cv738,10116,7,"thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact .",pos
7,cv738,10116,8,"watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience .",pos
7,cv738,10116,9,"spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later .",pos
7,cv738,10116,10,aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since .,pos
7,cv738,10116,11,"amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent .",pos
7,cv738,10116,12,"the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise .",pos
7,cv738,10116,13,"however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order .",pos
7,cv738,10116,14,"several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force .",pos
7,cv738,10116,15,"on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired .",pos
7,cv738,10116,16,"one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape .",pos
7,cv738,10116,17,"led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew .",pos
7,cv738,10116,18,"adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey .",pos
7,cv738,10116,19,"they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut .",pos
7,cv738,10116,20,"the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy .",pos
7,cv738,10116,21,the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) .,pos
7,cv738,10116,22,"they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute .",pos
7,cv738,10116,23,"aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge .",pos
7,cv738,10116,24,but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause .,pos
7,cv738,10116,25,"current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free .",pos
7,cv738,10116,26,"at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage .",pos
7,cv738,10116,27,cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to .,pos
7,cv738,10116,28,"he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up .",pos
7,cv738,10116,29,"effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies .",pos
7,cv738,10116,30,"they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success .",pos
7,cv738,10116,31,"to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals "" .",pos
7,cv738,10116,32,"the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity .",pos
7,cv738,10116,33,"as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense .",pos
7,cv738,10116,34,"the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property .",pos
7,cv738,10116,35,"in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything .",pos
7,cv738,10116,36,"amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history .",pos
7,cv738,10116,37,"four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them .",pos
7,cv738,10116,38,"baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque .",pos
7,cv738,10116,39,"even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate .",pos
7,cv738,10116,40,"aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch .",pos
7,cv738,10116,41,"matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case .",pos
7,cv738,10116,42,"likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . """,pos
7,cv738,10116,43,"nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election .",pos
7,cv738,10116,44,"finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done .",pos
7,cv738,10116,45,"hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams .",pos
7,cv738,10116,46,his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable .,pos
7,cv738,10116,47,one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain .,pos
7,cv738,10116,48,"schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for .",pos
7,cv738,10116,49,there is no such figure in amistad .,pos
7,cv738,10116,50,"the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary .",pos
7,cv738,10116,51,it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist .,pos
7,cv738,10116,52,"amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident .",pos

7,cv739,11209,1,"such is the case with "" the big lebowski , "" joel and ethan coen's first venture since their "" fargo "" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods .",pos
7,cv739,11209,2,"there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because "" lebowski "" is an effort that makes words like "" strange "" and "" unusual "" seem like an understatement .",pos
7,cv739,11209,3,"thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success .",pos
7,cv739,11209,4,"the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) .",pos
7,cv739,11209,5,"one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude .",pos
7,cv739,11209,6,"once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long .",pos
7,cv739,11209,7,"soon , though , lebowski's trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help .",pos
7,cv739,11209,8,it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn .,pos
7,cv739,11209,9,"the dude , now on lebowski's payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself .",pos
7,cv739,11209,10,"chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) .",pos
7,cv739,11209,11,""" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , "" lebowski "" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative .",pos
7,cv739,11209,12,"the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does .",pos
7,cv739,11209,13,"the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick .",pos
7,cv739,11209,14,"whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively .",pos
7,cv739,11209,15,"there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it's boring .",pos
7,cv739,11209,16,the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given .,pos
7,cv739,11209,17,"bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around , but you'd still follow him to another movie .",pos
7,cv739,11209,18,"goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration , as walter's manic temper is one of "" the big lebowski "" 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot .",pos
7,cv739,11209,19,john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction .,pos
7,cv739,11209,20,sam elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start .,pos
7,cv739,11209,21,"and some will recognize peter stormare -- "" fargo "" 's silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star .",pos
7,cv739,11209,22,"only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call .",pos
7,cv739,11209,23,"these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face .",pos

7,cv740,12445,3,"well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here .",pos

7,cv740,12445,5,"i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow .",pos
7,cv740,12445,6,"i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list .",pos
7,cv740,12445,7,"that , let me tell you , has changed completely .",pos
7,cv740,12445,8,"i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet .",pos
7,cv740,12445,9,the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .,pos
7,cv740,12445,10,seriously .,pos
7,cv740,12445,11,"i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry ,",pos

7,cv740,12445,13,"even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals .",pos
7,cv740,12445,14,my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout .,pos

7,cv740,12445,17,that's what really makes this movie unique .,pos
7,cv740,12445,18,it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .,pos
7,cv740,12445,19,suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's,pos
7,cv740,12445,20,the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and,pos
7,cv740,12445,21,never hit .,pos
7,cv740,12445,22,several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again .,pos
7,cv740,12445,23,the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .,pos
7,cv740,12445,24,"whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing .",pos
7,cv740,12445,25,"joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife .",pos
7,cv740,12445,26,i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it,pos
7,cv740,12445,27,would have wrecked her potrayal .,pos
7,cv740,12445,28,gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends .,pos
7,cv740,12445,29,other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a,pos

7,cv740,12445,31,"dominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's .",pos
7,cv740,12445,32,faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say .,pos
7,cv740,12445,33,"first , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good .",pos
7,cv740,12445,34,"after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - "" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? "" .",pos
7,cv740,12445,35,"there were certain bits that weren't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice .",pos
7,cv740,12445,36,"overall , this movie was not perfect .",pos
7,cv740,12445,37,but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .,pos
7,cv740,12445,38,many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i,pos
7,cv740,12445,39,certainly hope so .,pos
7,cv741,11890,0,"those print and television ads trumpeting that "" 'grease' is still the word "" are right on the money .",pos

7,cv741,11890,2,"that's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ?",pos

7,cv741,11890,8,"sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) .",pos
7,cv741,11890,9,"so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back .",pos
7,cv741,11890,10,"the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of "" greased lightening , "" the film's big "" guy "" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but "" grease "" 's flaws amount too few to carp .",pos
7,cv741,11890,11,"the movie's first showpiece is "" summer nights , "" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance .",pos
7,cv741,11890,12,"not only is "" nights "" tremendously catchy , but it's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes .",pos

7,cv741,11890,14,"all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated "" hopelessly devoted to you "" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing's lamenting ballad "" there are worse things i could do "" is one of "" grease "" 's most unjustly overlooked tunes .",pos
7,cv741,11890,15,"the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of "" nights "" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos .",pos
7,cv741,11890,16,"and it's a testament to "" grease "" 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it's the same all-around blast it's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music .",pos
7,cv741,11890,17,"to '90s viewers , "" grease "" will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts .",pos

7,cv742,7751,6,"this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes , wearing an underwater watch in one scene , and accidentally detonating a massive set .",pos
7,cv742,7751,7,many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever .,pos
7,cv742,7751,8,and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j .,pos

7,cv742,7751,13,"each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous .",pos
7,cv742,7751,14,"and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way .",pos
7,cv742,7751,15,"the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations .",pos
7,cv742,7751,16,"it also includes a number of memorable scenes ( can anyone say "" birdy num-num "" ? ) .",pos

7,cv743,15449,2,what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution .,pos
7,cv743,15449,3,"i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ?",pos
7,cv743,15449,4,"as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior .",pos
7,cv743,15449,5,"in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything .",pos
7,cv743,15449,6,but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison .,pos
7,cv743,15449,7,"a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs .",pos
7,cv743,15449,8,"in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining .",pos
7,cv743,15449,9,i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months .,pos
7,cv743,15449,10,"it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker .",pos
7,cv743,15449,11,"the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers .",pos
7,cv743,15449,12,"just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead .",pos
7,cv743,15449,13,"flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them .",pos
7,cv743,15449,14,"he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) .",pos
7,cv743,15449,15,"flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position .",pos
7,cv743,15449,16,the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation .,pos
7,cv743,15449,17,"created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen .",pos
7,cv743,15449,18,"the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action .",pos
7,cv743,15449,19,"this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative .",pos
7,cv743,15449,20,"the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) .",pos
7,cv743,15449,21,but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters .,pos
7,cv743,15449,22,"flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story .",pos
7,cv743,15449,23,"but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar .",pos
7,cv743,15449,24,"all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory .",pos
7,cv743,15449,25,"in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence .",pos
7,cv743,15449,26,"in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it .",pos
7,cv743,15449,27,"with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through .",pos
7,cv743,15449,28,"it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience .",pos
7,cv743,15449,29,"after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .",pos

7,cv744,10038,2,"you know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old "" masterpiece "" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox .",pos

7,cv765,19037,48,"by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department .",pos
7,cv765,19037,49,many of the studio's old men had retired or died .,pos
7,cv765,19037,50,"therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film .",pos
7,cv765,19037,51,"originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped .",pos
7,cv765,19037,52,"the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it .",pos
7,cv765,19037,53,"in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features .",pos
7,cv765,19037,54,"but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million .",pos
7,cv765,19037,55,"the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation .",pos
7,cv765,19037,56,"the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) .",pos

7,cv765,19037,58,"as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron .",pos
7,cv765,19037,59,"finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released .",pos
7,cv765,19037,60,"because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ?",pos
7,cv765,19037,61,the people who had seen the film didn't think so .,pos
7,cv765,19037,62,"in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it .",pos
7,cv765,19037,63,"for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom .",pos
7,cv765,19037,64,"few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat .",pos
7,cv765,19037,65,"but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) .",pos
7,cv765,19037,66,"somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states .",pos
7,cv765,19037,67,"before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs .",pos

7,cv765,19037,69,"even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed .",pos
7,cv765,19037,70,"some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't .",pos
7,cv765,19037,71,"but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available .",pos

7,cv765,19037,86,"but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck .",pos
7,cv765,19037,87,"the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be .",pos
7,cv765,19037,88,"the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale .",pos
7,cv765,19037,89,"elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner .",pos

7,cv772,12119,5,"few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall .",pos
7,cv772,12119,6,"and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion .",pos

7,cv779,17881,3,the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television .,pos
7,cv779,17881,4,"other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other .",pos
7,cv779,17881,5,reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e .,pos
7,cv779,17881,6,"the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies .",pos
7,cv779,17881,7,"when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman .",pos
7,cv779,17881,8,"the same goes for the thin red line , as well .",pos
7,cv779,17881,9,"when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever .",pos
7,cv779,17881,10,"critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards .",pos
7,cv779,17881,11,this is why i think pleasantville was underrated .,pos
7,cv779,17881,12,"if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves .",pos
7,cv779,17881,13,"sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history .",pos
7,cv779,17881,14,"with the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents .",pos
7,cv779,17881,15,"his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes .",pos
7,cv779,17881,16,"but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be .",pos
7,cv779,17881,17,"the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote .",pos

7,cv779,17881,27,"but the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it's what i least expected .",pos

7,cv780,7984,0,note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .,pos
7,cv780,7984,1,be forewarned .,pos
7,cv780,7984,2,"the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often .",pos
7,cv780,7984,3,"it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts .",pos
7,cv780,7984,4,"the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other .",pos
7,cv780,7984,5,"both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day .",pos
7,cv780,7984,6,"however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary .",pos
7,cv780,7984,7,"the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour .",pos
7,cv780,7984,8,the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan .,pos
7,cv780,7984,9,"for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background .",pos
7,cv780,7984,10,"my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one .",pos
7,cv780,7984,11,my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well .,pos
7,cv780,7984,12,"in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too .",pos
7,cv780,7984,13,"the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality .",pos
7,cv780,7984,14,"throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion .",pos
7,cv780,7984,15,"there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments .",pos
7,cv780,7984,16,"my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne .",pos
7,cv780,7984,17,"this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable .",pos
7,cv780,7984,18,"even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding .",pos
7,cv780,7984,19,"with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film .",pos
7,cv780,7984,20,"she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don't know what to do with myself "" .",pos
7,cv780,7984,21,"rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film .",pos
7,cv780,7984,22,"his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous .",pos
7,cv780,7984,23,"dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic .",pos
7,cv780,7984,24,"when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as "" america's sweetheart "" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile .",pos
7,cv780,7984,25,"while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game .",pos

7,cv781,5262,15,"dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects .",pos
7,cv781,5262,16,"several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics .",pos
7,cv781,5262,17,"because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater .",pos
7,cv781,5262,18,"although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre .",pos
7,cv781,5262,19,"rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society .",pos
7,cv781,5262,20,"the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors .",pos
7,cv781,5262,21,"these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore .",pos
7,cv781,5262,22,"the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood .",pos
7,cv781,5262,23,"1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society .",pos
7,cv781,5262,24,the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd .,pos
7,cv781,5262,25,verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary .,pos
7,cv781,5262,26,"unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre .",pos
7,cv781,5262,27,"the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens .",pos
7,cv781,5262,28,"robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character .",pos
7,cv781,5262,29,we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot .,pos
7,cv781,5262,30,"does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ?",pos
7,cv781,5262,31,the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action .,pos
7,cv781,5262,32,"moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine .",pos
7,cv781,5262,33,robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends .,pos
7,cv781,5262,34,"as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before .",pos
7,cv781,5262,35,"in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish .",pos
7,cv781,5262,36,"however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off .",pos
7,cv782,19526,0,"probably the most popular and praised film of all time , turned out to be a primitive and predictable costume drama with a dose of social criticism .",pos

7,cv782,19526,20,the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script .,pos

7,cv794,15868,1,"the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town .",pos
7,cv794,15868,2,"the six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town .",pos

8,cv808,12635,13,ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him .,pos
8,cv808,12635,14,"we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out .",pos
8,cv808,12635,15,"dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case .",pos
8,cv808,12635,16,"nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him .",pos

8,cv808,12635,18,silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film .,pos

8,cv808,12635,20,"there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical .",pos
8,cv808,12635,21,"yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well .",pos

8,cv808,12635,25,"the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters .",pos
8,cv808,12635,26,"yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons .",pos
8,cv808,12635,27,"as von bulow , he is brutally evil .",pos
8,cv808,12635,28,"anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame .",pos

8,cv808,12635,30,he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder .,pos
8,cv808,12635,31,"however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility .",pos
8,cv808,12635,32,there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness .,pos

8,cv809,5009,1,"it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film .",pos
8,cv809,5009,2,"but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy .",pos
8,cv809,5009,3,"driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago .",pos
8,cv809,5009,4,"the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union .",pos
8,cv809,5009,5,"uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza .",pos
8,cv809,5009,6,"the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur .",pos
8,cv809,5009,7,"the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action .",pos
8,cv809,5009,8,"in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together .",pos
8,cv809,5009,9,"rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on .",pos
8,cv809,5009,10,"the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr .",pos
8,cv809,5009,11,the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway .,pos
8,cv809,5009,12,"the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur .",pos
8,cv809,5009,13,"freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke .",pos
8,cv809,5009,14,the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger .,pos
8,cv809,5009,15,"driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon .",pos
8,cv809,5009,16,"daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur .",pos
8,cv809,5009,17,"initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere .",pos
8,cv809,5009,18,"once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver .",pos
8,cv809,5009,19,"to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand .",pos
8,cv809,5009,20,"eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him .",pos
8,cv809,5009,21,"tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace .",pos
8,cv809,5009,22,"we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon .",pos
8,cv809,5009,23,"nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own .",pos
8,cv809,5009,24,"freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances .",pos
8,cv809,5009,25,there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color .,pos
8,cv809,5009,26,"hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior .",pos
8,cv809,5009,27,"both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma .",pos
8,cv809,5009,28,they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves .,pos
8,cv809,5009,29,they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor .,pos
8,cv809,5009,30,"at the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama .",pos
8,cv809,5009,31,"in his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son .",pos
8,cv809,5009,32,"drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) .",pos
8,cv809,5009,33,"the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( "" good times "" ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone .",pos
8,cv809,5009,34,"under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again .",pos
8,cv809,5009,35,"but fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes .",pos
8,cv809,5009,36,"in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety .",pos
8,cv809,5009,37,uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say .,pos

8,cv810,12458,3,"for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for .",pos

8,cv810,12458,5,"martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all .",pos
8,cv810,12458,6,"the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights .",pos
8,cv810,12458,7,"the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world .",pos

8,cv810,12458,12,"that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi .",pos
8,cv810,12458,13,"as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations .",pos
8,cv810,12458,14,"for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .",pos
8,cv810,12458,15,"for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .",pos
8,cv810,12458,16,brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .,pos
8,cv810,12458,17,"his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .",pos
8,cv810,12458,18,"his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .",pos
8,cv810,12458,19,"however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .",pos
8,cv810,12458,20,"but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against "" scum "" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it .",pos
8,cv810,12458,21,"while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .",pos
8,cv810,12458,22,"wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff "" .",pos
8,cv810,12458,23,his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .,pos
8,cv810,12458,24,"other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .",pos
8,cv810,12458,25,"matthew "" sport "" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture .",pos

8,cv810,12458,27,"even the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless "" messages "" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis .",pos
8,cv810,12458,28,"the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end .",pos
8,cv810,12458,29,"travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen .",pos

8,cv810,12458,31,"another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture .",pos
8,cv810,12458,32,"one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason .",pos
8,cv810,12458,33,"instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie .",pos

8,cv812,17924,15,the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death .,pos
8,cv812,17924,16,"nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be .",pos
8,cv812,17924,17,once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle .,pos
8,cv812,17924,18,"when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling .",pos
8,cv812,17924,19,"considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today .",pos
8,cv812,17924,20,"and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting .",pos
8,cv812,17924,21,"the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead .",pos

8,cv812,17924,25,and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were .,pos
8,cv812,17924,26,"i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film .",pos
8,cv812,17924,27,"perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking .",pos

8,cv815,22456,26,galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .,pos

8,cv817,4041,31,"her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi .",pos

8,cv817,4041,33,"it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality .",pos

8,cv817,4041,37,"kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy .",pos

8,cv817,4041,39,"plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation .",pos
8,cv817,4041,40,plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie .,pos
8,cv817,4041,41,"some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying .",pos
8,cv817,4041,42,"this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well .",pos
8,cv817,4041,43,"i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making .",pos

8,cv818,10211,0,"it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction .",pos
8,cv818,10211,1,"since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn .",pos
8,cv818,10211,2,"in between , he has moonlighted as an "" actor "" with several decidedly unmemorable performances .",pos
8,cv818,10211,3,"now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown .",pos
8,cv818,10211,4,"and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed .",pos
8,cv818,10211,5,"for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie .",pos
8,cv818,10211,6,"the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses .",pos
8,cv818,10211,7,"and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet .",pos
8,cv818,10211,8,"yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown .",pos
8,cv818,10211,9,"the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent .",pos
8,cv818,10211,10,the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives .,pos
8,cv818,10211,11,and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around .,pos
8,cv818,10211,12,"there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it .",pos
8,cv818,10211,13,"jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives .",pos
8,cv818,10211,14,"this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire .",pos
8,cv818,10211,15,"however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional .",pos
8,cv818,10211,16,"had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost .",pos
8,cv818,10211,17,"as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity .",pos
8,cv818,10211,18,"for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon .",pos
8,cv818,10211,19,"this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) .",pos
8,cv818,10211,20,"in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits .",pos
8,cv818,10211,21,there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) .,pos
8,cv818,10211,22,"grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states .",pos
8,cv818,10211,23,"she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official .",pos
8,cv818,10211,24,"no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's "" banyon "" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal .",pos
8,cv818,10211,25,"jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds .",pos
8,cv818,10211,26,"soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) .",pos
8,cv818,10211,27,"unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction .",pos
8,cv818,10211,28,"in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) .",pos
8,cv818,10211,29,robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles .,pos
8,cv818,10211,30,"bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish .",pos
8,cv818,10211,31,"robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor .",pos
8,cv818,10211,32,"the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) .",pos
8,cv818,10211,33,"tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself .",pos
8,cv818,10211,34,"when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort .",pos
8,cv818,10211,35,"it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .",pos
8,cv819,9364,0,one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable .,pos
8,cv819,9364,1,"you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is .",pos
8,cv819,9364,2,"sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch .",pos
8,cv819,9364,3,"this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun .",pos
8,cv819,9364,4,"one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story .",pos
8,cv819,9364,5,this rule applies highly to kiss the girls .,pos
8,cv819,9364,6,"there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made .",pos
8,cv819,9364,7,"however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through .",pos
8,cv819,9364,8,"well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up .",pos
8,cv819,9364,9,"unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits .",pos
8,cv819,9364,10,"that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery .",pos
8,cv819,9364,11,"however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film .",pos
8,cv819,9364,12,"plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality .",pos
8,cv819,9364,13,"we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero .",pos
8,cv819,9364,14,he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself .,pos
8,cv819,9364,15,"obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene .",pos
8,cv819,9364,16,"at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days .",pos
8,cv819,9364,17,"this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross .",pos
8,cv819,9364,18,"however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . .",pos
8,cv819,9364,19,before she is abducted .,pos
8,cv819,9364,20,"dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself .",pos
8,cv819,9364,21,"because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful .",pos
8,cv819,9364,22,"after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods .",pos
8,cv819,9364,23,"remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out .",pos
8,cv819,9364,24,"when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall .",pos
8,cv819,9364,25,"after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice .",pos
8,cv819,9364,26,"from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive .",pos
8,cv819,9364,27,"many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional .",pos
8,cv819,9364,28,"the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form .",pos
8,cv819,9364,29,what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness .,pos
8,cv819,9364,30,"the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us .",pos
8,cv819,9364,31,sometimes a simple shot is the best one .,pos
8,cv819,9364,32,"however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight .",pos
8,cv819,9364,33,"the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way .",pos
8,cv819,9364,34,"the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well .",pos
8,cv819,9364,35,"the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing .",pos
8,cv819,9364,36,"however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors .",pos
8,cv819,9364,37,morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors .,pos
8,cv819,9364,38,"detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven .",pos
8,cv819,9364,39,"because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself .",pos
8,cv819,9364,40,"the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses .",pos
8,cv819,9364,41,"in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible .",pos
8,cv819,9364,42,"her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully .",pos
8,cv819,9364,43,we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream .,pos
8,cv819,9364,44,"the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it .",pos
8,cv819,9364,45,"cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character .",pos
8,cv819,9364,46,"tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either .",pos
8,cv819,9364,47,"gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes .",pos
8,cv819,9364,48,"so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job .",pos
8,cv819,9364,49,"some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year .",pos
8,cv819,9364,50,two other essential aspects of the film are quite good .,pos
8,cv819,9364,51,"director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer .",pos
8,cv819,9364,52,"he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes .",pos
8,cv819,9364,53,"however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half .",pos
8,cv819,9364,54,part of the blame falls on david klass .,pos
8,cv819,9364,55,"i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts .",pos
8,cv819,9364,56,"while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible .",pos
8,cv819,9364,57,"thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent .",pos
8,cv819,9364,58,"none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced .",pos
8,cv819,9364,59,one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer .,pos
8,cv819,9364,60,"i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) .",pos
8,cv819,9364,61,"kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex .",pos
8,cv819,9364,62,"with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain .",pos
8,cv819,9364,63,"in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances .",pos
8,cv819,9364,64,"the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart .",pos
8,cv819,9364,65,this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through .,pos
8,cv819,9364,66,"morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt .",pos
8,cv819,9364,67,i must also say that i loved the ending .,pos
8,cv819,9364,68,"the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer .",pos
8,cv819,9364,69,"perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway .",pos
8,cv820,22892,0,i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars .,pos
8,cv820,22892,1,"from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning .",pos
8,cv820,22892,2,"from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece .",pos
8,cv820,22892,3,"the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer's complete attention .",pos
8,cv820,22892,4,"miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film .",pos
8,cv820,22892,5,"also like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending .",pos
8,cv820,22892,6,mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games .,pos
8,cv820,22892,7,"like his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim .",pos
8,cv820,22892,8,"because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film .",pos
8,cv820,22892,9,"mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end .",pos
8,cv820,22892,10,"the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious .",pos
8,cv820,22892,11,the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued .,pos
8,cv820,22892,12,"after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening .",pos
8,cv820,22892,13,"his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them .",pos
8,cv820,22892,14,"the story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative "" process "" that everyone is trying to get their hands on .",pos
8,cv820,22892,15,"soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his "" process . """,pos
8,cv820,22892,16,"through his journey ross meets a number of mysterious characters : the rich and popular jimmy dell , a secretary who has a huge crush on ross , and ross' boss mr . klein .",pos
8,cv820,22892,17,"played by steve martin , rebecca pidgeon , and ben gazarra respectively , the supporting cast is very solid especially martin , who deserved an oscar nomination for his commanding and manipulative role .",pos
8,cv820,22892,18,"the most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott's joe ross .",pos
8,cv820,22892,19,the character's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable .,pos
8,cv820,22892,20,"david mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them .",pos
8,cv820,22892,21,his beguiling style could fool any viewer up for the challenge .,pos
8,cv820,22892,22,"this is a must see , for those interested in solving a complex puzzle of a movie .",pos
8,cv821,29364,0,"an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material .",pos
8,cv821,29364,1,"the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .",pos
8,cv821,29364,2,"instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice .",pos
8,cv821,29364,3,"upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days .",pos
8,cv821,29364,4,"of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .",pos
8,cv821,29364,5,"in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .",pos
8,cv821,29364,6,"rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .",pos
8,cv821,29364,7,i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .,pos
8,cv821,29364,8,"but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .",pos
8,cv821,29364,9,"ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .",pos
8,cv821,29364,10,"throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character .",pos
8,cv821,29364,11,the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .,pos
8,cv821,29364,12,director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .,pos
8,cv821,29364,13,"the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .",pos
8,cv821,29364,14,the reason ?,pos
8,cv821,29364,15,mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .,pos
8,cv821,29364,16,"the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .",pos
8,cv821,29364,17,"unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone .",pos
8,cv821,29364,18,"rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .",pos
8,cv821,29364,19,it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .,pos
8,cv821,29364,20,"several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .",pos
8,cv821,29364,21,"early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .",pos
8,cv821,29364,22,"after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past .",pos
8,cv821,29364,23,it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .,pos
8,cv821,29364,24,but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .,pos

8,cv822,20049,21,"you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary .",pos

8,cv822,20049,23,"grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character .",pos

8,cv822,20049,25,"another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so .",pos
8,cv822,20049,26,"michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge .",pos
8,cv822,20049,27,"speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied .",pos

8,cv829,20289,15,"brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .",pos
8,cv829,20289,16,"in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak .",pos

8,cv829,20289,18,"it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy .",pos

8,cv829,20289,21,"the funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese .",pos
8,cv829,20289,22,"i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary .",pos

8,cv829,20289,27,"unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood .",pos

8,cv830,6014,13,"while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other .",pos
8,cv830,6014,14,"the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance .",pos
8,cv830,6014,15,"her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well .",pos
8,cv830,6014,16,"leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage .",pos

8,cv830,6014,20,"still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power .",pos
8,cv830,6014,21,"huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone .",pos
8,cv830,6014,22,"her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective .",pos
8,cv830,6014,23,"huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile .",pos
8,cv830,6014,24,"the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience .",pos

8,cv831,14689,14,"still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .",pos
8,cv831,14689,15,"agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever .",pos
8,cv831,14689,16,period .,pos
8,cv831,14689,17,"razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .",pos
8,cv831,14689,18,"the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .",pos
8,cv831,14689,19,"but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions .",pos
8,cv831,14689,20,"that is , unless that is intentional .",pos

8,cv831,14689,25,"and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .",pos
8,cv831,14689,26,"the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .",pos
8,cv831,14689,27,"but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find .",pos
8,cv831,14689,28,"as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .",pos
8,cv831,14689,29,"almost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film .",pos

8,cv832,23275,3,pitch black is a morality play masquerading as a scare-fest .,pos

8,cv832,23275,5,a cargo spaceship crash lands on a planet apparently leeched of life by the scorching heat of three suns .,pos
8,cv832,23275,6,"among the survivors is fry ( mitchell ) , the ship's pilot , who spends the film wrestling with the fact that she tried to jettison the other passengers in her effort to land the craft safely .",pos

8,cv832,23275,17,"pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock "" escape the boogieman "" conflicts the genre typically serves up .",pos
8,cv832,23275,18,"just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false .",pos
8,cv832,23275,19,"the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth .",pos
8,cv832,23275,20,"a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations .",pos
8,cv832,23275,21,i found it telling that an accidental death occurs early on due to the misperception of a self professed atheist .,pos

8,cv832,23275,27,it is a fascinating character study hiding under the guise of a scare flick .,pos
8,cv832,23275,28,"special mention should be made of vin diesel , who intriguingly conveys feral menace combined with a truly mesmerizing presence .",pos
8,cv832,23275,29,"his character could have easily slipped into a parody of the baddass killing machine , but twohy and diesel add surprising depth to riddick .",pos
8,cv832,23275,30,they can be excused for the two or three shwarzenegger-like catch phrases that growl their way out of diesel's mouth .,pos
8,cv832,23275,31,the movie has its flaws that can be nitpicked .,pos

8,cv832,23275,34,"yes , the appearance of riddick's vision skills are more than a little timely considering the situation .",pos
8,cv832,23275,35,these trappings are on the periphery of the story twohy is really trying to tell .,pos
8,cv832,23275,36,"twohy may have lured you in under the pretense of scaring you with film fabricated boogieman , but he shows the real boogieman to be the prejudices and beliefs we use to direct decisions in our lives .",pos

8,cv833,11053,1,"when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine . """,pos
8,cv833,11053,2,"i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea .",pos
8,cv833,11053,3,"it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale .",pos
8,cv833,11053,4,the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .,pos
8,cv833,11053,5,"we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk .",pos
8,cv833,11053,6,he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this .,pos
8,cv833,11053,7,"somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him .",pos
8,cv833,11053,8,"it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade .",pos
8,cv833,11053,9,i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .,pos
8,cv833,11053,10,"however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer .",pos
8,cv833,11053,11,"the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to .",pos
8,cv833,11053,12,"the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original .",pos
8,cv833,11053,13,"most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable .",pos
8,cv833,11053,14,"thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development .",pos
8,cv833,11053,15,much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .,pos
8,cv833,11053,16,pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .,pos
8,cv833,11053,17,"he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be .",pos
8,cv833,11053,18,"we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him .",pos
8,cv833,11053,19,"newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run .",pos
8,cv833,11053,20,"as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed .",pos
8,cv833,11053,21,"most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole .",pos
8,cv833,11053,22,"the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar .",pos
8,cv833,11053,23,"the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning .",pos
8,cv833,11053,24,"back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering .",pos
8,cv833,11053,25,"since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic .",pos
8,cv833,11053,26,"my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .",pos
8,cv833,11053,27,"a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff .",pos
8,cv833,11053,28,"we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful .",pos
8,cv833,11053,29,"aside from a few minor , general flaws , "" donnie brasco "" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development .",pos

8,cv834,22195,3,"on a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length .",pos
8,cv834,22195,4,"the mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to "" old sparky , "" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana's cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 .",pos

8,cv834,22195,11,perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark .,pos
8,cv834,22195,12,"or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he "" takes back "" paul's bladder infection thereby restoring him to health .",pos
8,cv834,22195,13,"based on steven king's 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner "" fry "" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he's witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor .",pos
8,cv834,22195,14,"while it is mr . hanks "" everyman "" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting .",pos

8,cv834,22195,18,mr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters .,pos
8,cv834,22195,19,was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ?,pos
8,cv834,22195,20,"by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted .",pos
8,cv834,22195,21,this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched .,pos
8,cv834,22195,22,"much has also been made of coffey's christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey's powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like "" i feel your pain "" transference .",pos

8,cv836,12968,15,"in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea .",pos
8,cv836,12968,16,"although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .",pos
8,cv836,12968,17,"despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible .",pos
8,cv836,12968,18,"the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false .",pos

8,cv836,12968,22,the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing .,pos
8,cv836,12968,23,"there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .",pos
8,cv836,12968,24,"in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling .",pos
8,cv836,12968,25,"still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city .",pos
8,cv836,12968,26,"i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans .",pos
8,cv836,12968,27,"cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ?",pos
8,cv836,12968,28,ms . linney is a delight in the film .,pos
8,cv836,12968,29,but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here .,pos
8,cv836,12968,30,he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman .,pos
8,cv836,12968,31,"in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .",pos
8,cv836,12968,32,it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention .,pos
8,cv836,12968,33,"in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score .",pos

8,cv836,12968,35,"while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner .",pos

8,cv836,12968,37,"the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario .",pos
8,cv836,12968,38,perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question .,pos

8,cv837,27325,2,"this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through .",pos
8,cv837,27325,3,"making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year .",pos
8,cv837,27325,4,"what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .",pos
8,cv837,27325,5,"the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness .",pos
8,cv837,27325,6,"chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .",pos

8,cv837,27325,8,"many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .",pos
8,cv837,27325,9,"on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .",pos
8,cv837,27325,10,"also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .",pos
8,cv837,27325,11,"juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .",pos
8,cv837,27325,12,"lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .",pos

8,cv837,27325,14,"carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .",pos
8,cv837,27325,15,"victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down .",pos
8,cv837,27325,16,"a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . """,pos
8,cv837,27325,17,"that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .",pos
8,cv837,27325,18,"the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .",pos
8,cv837,27325,19,"cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .",pos
8,cv837,27325,20,"chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .",pos
8,cv837,27325,21,"while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale .",pos

8,cv840,16321,17,"today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .",pos
8,cv840,16321,18,"today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .",pos
8,cv840,16321,19,"secondly , a lack of talent .",pos
8,cv840,16321,20,"performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .",pos
8,cv840,16321,21,"most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .",pos

8,cv844,12690,29,"the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics .",pos
8,cv844,12690,30,"unlike "" primary colors "" which opened earlier this year , "" bulworth "" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on .",pos

8,cv845,14290,15,"not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them .",pos

8,cv845,14290,17,"the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work .",pos

8,cv845,14290,20,one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller .,pos
8,cv845,14290,21,"he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation .",pos
8,cv845,14290,22,"ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out .",pos
8,cv845,14290,23,"it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top .",pos
8,cv845,14290,24,"actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties .",pos
8,cv845,14290,25,"the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money .",pos
8,cv845,14290,26,"in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler .",pos
8,cv845,14290,27,"it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93 .",pos
8,cv845,14290,28,"like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation .",pos
8,cv845,14290,29,"cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times .",pos
8,cv845,14290,30,"however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her .",pos
8,cv845,14290,31,"heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week .",pos

8,cv845,14290,37,"chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy .",pos
8,cv845,14290,38,"lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film .",pos
8,cv845,14290,39,"lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist .",pos
8,cv845,14290,40,the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags .,pos
8,cv845,14290,41,the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .,pos
8,cv845,14290,42,they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .,pos
8,cv845,14290,43,it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .,pos
8,cv845,14290,44,"after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow .",pos
8,cv845,14290,45,"fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .",pos

8,cv846,29497,3,"critique : a very good , serious-minded , unique british gangster flick which misses the "" great "" mark by way of an annoying voice-over popping up throughout the film and a so-so ending .",pos

8,cv846,29497,5,"okay , so it's not entirely new , but it's definitely original when all put together as done here .",pos
8,cv846,29497,6,the thing i liked most about this movie was its authentic portrayal of the time period in which it was taking place .,pos
8,cv846,29497,7,it's 1968 and these dudes are looking good !,pos
8,cv846,29497,8,"yes , it's all about the suits , fellas . . . the",pos

8,cv846,29497,10,"here are a bunch of horrible men , gangsters if you will , looking sharp , talking shit and busting heads all over the place .",pos
8,cv846,29497,11,but that's not the basis of this movie .,pos
8,cv846,29497,12,"the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other .",pos
8,cv846,29497,13,"you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ?",pos
8,cv846,29497,14,"well , most of the time , these dudes are screened beforehand and are loyal to only one person . . . that",pos
8,cv846,29497,15,"is , their boss .",pos

8,cv846,29497,19,"nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this .",pos
8,cv846,29497,20,the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty !,pos

8,cv846,29497,24,but there's an ever better scene than that in this film .,pos
8,cv846,29497,25,"this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear ) .",pos
8,cv846,29497,26,"that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) .",pos
8,cv846,29497,27,but the flick's not perfect .,pos
8,cv846,29497,28,"in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot .",pos

8,cv846,29497,36,"but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot .",pos
8,cv846,29497,37,"forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis .",pos
8,cv846,29497,38,"incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal !",pos

8,cv862,14324,43,"in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance .",pos
8,cv862,14324,44,even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .,pos
8,cv862,14324,45,the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place .,pos
8,cv862,14324,46,"the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken .",pos
8,cv862,14324,47,the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war .,pos
8,cv862,14324,48,fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is .,pos
8,cv862,14324,49,"one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , "" no !",pos

8,cv862,14324,52,"another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be .",pos
8,cv862,14324,53,"as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north .",pos
8,cv862,14324,54,"she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat .",pos
8,cv862,14324,55,this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship .,pos
8,cv862,14324,56,most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett .,pos
8,cv862,14324,57,"each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other .",pos
8,cv862,14324,58,scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .,pos
8,cv862,14324,59,"they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization .",pos
8,cv862,14324,60,"they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together .",pos
8,cv862,14324,61,"perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .",pos
8,cv862,14324,62,"both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .",pos
8,cv862,14324,63,"love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why .",pos
8,cv862,14324,64,"gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture .",pos

8,cv862,14324,66,none ?,pos
8,cv862,14324,67,either way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings .,pos
8,cv862,14324,68,"it's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in "" gone with the wind , "" but it's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we've just experienced a life's worth of joy and pain .",pos
8,cv863,7424,0,not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies .,pos
8,cv863,7424,1,"like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations .",pos
8,cv863,7424,2,"also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces .",pos
8,cv863,7424,3,and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film .,pos
8,cv863,7424,4,all that is missing is a discussion of god .,pos
8,cv863,7424,5,which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master .,pos
8,cv863,7424,6,"in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind .",pos
8,cv863,7424,7,"nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms .",pos
8,cv863,7424,8,"once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards .",pos
8,cv863,7424,9,one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is .,pos
8,cv863,7424,10,"though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all .",pos
8,cv863,7424,11,"whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary .",pos
8,cv863,7424,12,the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors .,pos
8,cv863,7424,13,"it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting .",pos
8,cv863,7424,14,"much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is .",pos
8,cv863,7424,15,there are a few missteps .,pos
8,cv863,7424,16,"for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film .",pos
8,cv863,7424,17,this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout .,pos
8,cv863,7424,18,and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced .,pos
8,cv863,7424,19,"for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention .",pos
8,cv863,7424,20,"it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film .",pos
8,cv863,7424,21,"in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it .",pos
8,cv863,7424,22,"there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe .",pos
8,cv863,7424,23,"nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart .",pos
8,cv863,7424,24,"though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen .",pos
8,cv863,7424,25,"needless to say , it is also very depressing at times .",pos
8,cv863,7424,26,"but for many of us , of course , so is life .",pos
8,cv863,7424,27,"and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .",pos

8,cv864,3416,1,"muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia .",pos
8,cv864,3416,2,"she is often the target of her father's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage .",pos
8,cv864,3416,3,her self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired .,pos
8,cv864,3416,4,"after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel's wedding unfolds from there .",pos
8,cv864,3416,5,"toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted .",pos
8,cv864,3416,6,collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character .,pos
8,cv864,3416,7,"she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance .",pos
8,cv864,3416,8,"collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene .",pos
8,cv864,3416,9,"muriel's father , bill "" the battler "" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer .",pos
8,cv864,3416,10,"while chumming around with young fans and crowing 'you can't beat progress' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments .",pos
8,cv864,3416,11,"rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel's cheeky new friend in the film .",pos
8,cv864,3416,12,"she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen .",pos
8,cv864,3416,13,"muriel's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan's scripting",pos
8,cv864,3416,14,muriel's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm .,pos
8,cv864,3416,15,"hogan's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile .",pos
8,cv864,3416,16,"hogan's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her .",pos
8,cv864,3416,17,the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch .,pos
8,cv864,3416,18,"muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan .",pos
8,cv864,3416,19,"on my four star scale , i give muriel's wedding three stars .",pos
8,cv865,2895,0,"every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise .",pos

8,cv865,2895,2,"usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo .",pos
8,cv865,2895,3,"it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly .",pos
8,cv865,2895,4,"that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing .",pos
8,cv865,2895,5,"what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history .",pos
8,cv865,2895,6,"princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside .",pos
8,cv865,2895,7,"apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) .",pos
8,cv865,2895,8,"her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo .",pos
8,cv865,2895,9,"this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall .",pos
8,cv865,2895,10,"however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo .",pos
8,cv865,2895,11,"as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner .",pos
8,cv865,2895,12,"it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing .",pos
8,cv865,2895,13,"but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude .",pos
8,cv865,2895,14,"he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort .",pos
8,cv865,2895,15,"while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed .",pos
8,cv865,2895,16,"he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a "" sensation "" at court .",pos
8,cv865,2895,17,"in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance .",pos
8,cv865,2895,18,"it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in "" sensations , "" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) .",pos
8,cv865,2895,19,"social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment .",pos
8,cv865,2895,20,"the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime .",pos
8,cv865,2895,21,"her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch .",pos
8,cv865,2895,22,"only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity .",pos
8,cv865,2895,23,"the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky .",pos
8,cv865,2895,24,"it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .",pos
8,cv865,2895,25,"when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible .",pos
8,cv865,2895,26,princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp .,pos
8,cv865,2895,27,"still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out .",pos

8,cv866,29691,29,what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism .,pos

8,cv868,11948,28,what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation .,pos
8,cv868,11948,29,"director brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality .",pos

8,cv868,11948,31,there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information .,pos
8,cv868,11948,32,"this is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real .",pos
8,cv868,11948,33,the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do .,pos
8,cv868,11948,34,cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) .,pos
8,cv868,11948,35,"the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely .",pos
8,cv868,11948,36,the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far .,pos
8,cv868,11948,37,all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre .,pos
8,cv868,11948,38,it's a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .,pos

8,cv872,12591,17,"in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains .",pos

8,cv872,12591,20,"to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio .",pos

8,cv874,11236,29,"a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes .",pos

8,cv875,5754,12,matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty .,pos
8,cv875,5754,13,"it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda .",pos
8,cv875,5754,14,"and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito .",pos
8,cv875,5754,15,"devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images .",pos

8,cv875,5754,17,matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale .,pos
8,cv875,5754,18,it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them .,pos

8,cv875,5754,20,"matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "" i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . """,pos
8,cv875,5754,21,"more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave .",pos

8,cv875,5754,25,"the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character .",pos

8,cv878,15694,9,"almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , "" i know what you did last summer , "" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook .",pos
8,cv878,15694,10,""" i know what you did last summer , "" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons .",pos
8,cv878,15694,11,"the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings .",pos
8,cv878,15694,12,"the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort .",pos
8,cv878,15694,13,"and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family's store with the killer inside with her .",pos
8,cv878,15694,14,"perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit .",pos
8,cv878,15694,15,"heche's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time .",pos
8,cv878,15694,16,""" i know what you did last summer , "" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems .",pos
8,cv878,15694,17,"prinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth .",pos
8,cv878,15694,18,"also , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines .",pos
8,cv878,15694,19,"luckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted "" jump-in-your-seat "" scare .",pos
8,cv878,15694,20,"in the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i've ever heard .",pos
8,cv878,15694,21,"she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best "" scream queen . """,pos
8,cv878,15694,22,"and gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered .",pos
8,cv878,15694,23,"although not up to the level of either "" scream "" movies , or the more recent , "" urban legend , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made .",pos
8,cv879,14903,0,labelling is sometimes everything .,pos
8,cv879,14903,1,"in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own .",pos
8,cv879,14903,2,walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors .,pos
8,cv879,14903,3,producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones .,pos
8,cv879,14903,4,"on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america .",pos
8,cv879,14903,5,"to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago .",pos
8,cv879,14903,6,"instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city .",pos
8,cv879,14903,7,"the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx .",pos
8,cv879,14903,8,"that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce .",pos
8,cv879,14903,9,"on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city .",pos
8,cv879,14903,10,"crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus .",pos
8,cv879,14903,11,"police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs .",pos
8,cv879,14903,12,"the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs .",pos
8,cv879,14903,13,"upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status .",pos
8,cv879,14903,14,"however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year .",pos
8,cv879,14903,15,the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly .,pos
8,cv879,14903,16,"if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably .",pos
8,cv879,14903,17,the future was much worse than his vision .,pos
8,cv879,14903,18,"the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities .",pos
8,cv879,14903,19,"their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime .",pos
8,cv879,14903,20,"in their vocabulary , word "" arms "" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns .",pos
8,cv879,14903,21,"they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own .",pos
8,cv879,14903,22,many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors .,pos
8,cv879,14903,23,some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour .,pos
8,cv879,14903,24,"despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film .",pos
8,cv879,14903,25,"the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes .",pos
8,cv879,14903,26,"the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie .",pos
8,cv879,14903,27,"editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory .",pos
8,cv879,14903,28,the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable .,pos
8,cv879,14903,29,"yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity .",pos
8,cv879,14903,30,"best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains .",pos
8,cv879,14903,31,"michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot .",pos
8,cv879,14903,32,"all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies .",pos
8,cv880,29800,0,"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative .",pos
8,cv880,29800,1,"written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement .",pos
8,cv880,29800,2,slow is the best description for the film at first .,pos

8,cv880,29800,4,father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities .,pos
8,cv880,29800,5,"they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder .",pos

8,cv880,29800,7,"but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident .",pos
8,cv880,29800,8,"the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span .",pos
8,cv880,29800,9,"though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving .",pos
8,cv880,29800,10,"though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece .",pos
8,cv880,29800,11,"one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable .",pos
8,cv880,29800,12,"what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction .",pos
8,cv880,29800,13,"the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss .",pos
8,cv880,29800,14,"you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing .",pos
8,cv880,29800,15,"you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation .",pos
8,cv880,29800,16,even better are the role reversals that take place within the household .,pos
8,cv880,29800,17,"while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot .",pos
8,cv880,29800,18,"not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them .",pos
8,cv880,29800,19,"these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change .",pos
8,cv880,29800,20,"respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture .",pos
8,cv880,29800,21,"self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family .",pos
8,cv880,29800,22,"though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives .",pos
8,cv880,29800,23,"most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing .",pos
8,cv880,29800,24,"in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .",pos
8,cv880,29800,25,"it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .",pos
8,cv881,13254,0,the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all .,pos
8,cv881,13254,1,what does takes place is more based on character development .,pos
8,cv881,13254,2,"the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid .",pos

8,cv881,13254,10,set in a small ( fictional ? ),pos
8,cv881,13254,11,"town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings .",pos
8,cv881,13254,12,"the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future .",pos
8,cv881,13254,13,particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her .,pos
8,cv881,13254,14,"not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future .",pos

8,cv882,10026,0,airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making .,pos

8,cv882,10026,7,there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade .,pos
8,cv882,10026,8,"and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film .",pos

8,cv888,24435,28,"a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick .",pos
8,cv888,24435,29,"you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .",pos
8,cv888,24435,30,phoenix plays his character brilliantly .,pos
8,cv888,24435,31,"think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , "" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man "" brat who hates when he's not the center of attention .",pos
8,cv888,24435,32,"every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying .",pos

8,cv888,24435,34,crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero .,pos

8,cv888,24435,39,"the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 .",pos
8,cv888,24435,40,the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians .,pos
8,cv888,24435,41,gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience .,pos

8,cv889,21430,30,famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .,pos
8,cv889,21430,31,ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .,pos
8,cv889,21430,32,chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .,pos
8,cv889,21430,33,peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .,pos

8,cv889,21430,36,i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .,pos
8,cv889,21430,37,one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore .,pos
8,cv889,21430,38,"even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell .",pos
8,cv889,21430,39,"the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with .",pos
8,cv889,21430,40,the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .,pos
8,cv889,21430,41,i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .,pos

8,cv889,21430,45,though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws .,pos
8,cv889,21430,46,"but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !",pos
8,cv890,3977,0,apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) .,pos
8,cv890,3977,1,"director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 .",pos
8,cv890,3977,2,"being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet .",pos
8,cv890,3977,3,"perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . .",pos
8,cv890,3977,4,all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles .,pos
8,cv890,3977,5,apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) .,pos
8,cv890,3977,6,"jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon .",pos
8,cv890,3977,7,suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . .,pos
8,cv890,3977,8,if they ever reach it .,pos
8,cv890,3977,9,"ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly .",pos
8,cv890,3977,10,"audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space .",pos
8,cv890,3977,11,"also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 .",pos
8,cv890,3977,12,"the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner .",pos
8,cv890,3977,13,"watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film .",pos
8,cv890,3977,14,a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script .,pos
8,cv890,3977,15,those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show .,pos
8,cv890,3977,16,"this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film .",pos
8,cv890,3977,17,you should enjoy it .,pos
8,cv891,6385,0,"in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well .",pos
8,cv891,6385,1,"yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it .",pos
8,cv891,6385,2,"i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out .",pos
8,cv891,6385,3,it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering .,pos
8,cv891,6385,4,"so , i shrugged , thought , "" hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , "" so i signed up .",pos
8,cv891,6385,5,"all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either .",pos
8,cv891,6385,6,"rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ?",pos
8,cv891,6385,7,"you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey .",pos
8,cv891,6385,8,"sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed .",pos
8,cv891,6385,9,"when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out .",pos
8,cv891,6385,10,"there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature .",pos
8,cv891,6385,11,"in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors .",pos
8,cv891,6385,12,the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup .,pos
8,cv891,6385,13,"subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled .",pos
8,cv891,6385,14,"we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others .",pos
8,cv891,6385,15,we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons .,pos
8,cv891,6385,16,"and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ .",pos
8,cv891,6385,17,and it's a big one .,pos
8,cv891,6385,18,">from there on in , it's sly stallone to the rescue .",pos
8,cv891,6385,19,"and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style .",pos
8,cv891,6385,20,again . . . there's,pos
8,cv891,6385,21,nothing new here .,pos
8,cv891,6385,22,and yet there doesn't need to be .,pos
8,cv891,6385,23,the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution .,pos
8,cv891,6385,24,"the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together .",pos
8,cv891,6385,25,"once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way .",pos

8,cv892,17576,0,perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects .,pos
8,cv892,17576,1,there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .,pos
8,cv892,17576,2,"whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology .",pos
8,cv892,17576,3,"the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story .",pos
8,cv892,17576,4,"unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event .",pos
8,cv892,17576,5,"it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length .",pos
8,cv892,17576,6,"contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound .",pos
8,cv892,17576,7,"in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp .",pos
8,cv892,17576,8,"with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented .",pos
8,cv892,17576,9,"the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach .",pos
8,cv892,17576,10,"but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent .",pos
8,cv892,17576,11,the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .,pos
8,cv892,17576,12,"and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story .",pos
8,cv892,17576,13,"as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind .",pos
8,cv892,17576,14,"billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy .",pos
8,cv892,17576,15,"only a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .",pos
8,cv892,17576,16,"morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth .",pos
8,cv892,17576,17,the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .,pos
8,cv892,17576,18,"the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy .",pos
8,cv892,17576,19,"the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles .",pos
8,cv892,17576,20,"for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of "" agents "" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .",pos
8,cv892,17576,21,"the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool .",pos
8,cv892,17576,22,"supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual .",pos
8,cv892,17576,23,"one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach .",pos
8,cv892,17576,24,"the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .",pos
8,cv892,17576,25,"the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .",pos
8,cv893,26269,0,let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies .,pos
8,cv893,26269,1,"i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven .",pos
8,cv893,26269,2,was it any good ?,pos
8,cv893,26269,3,"well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) .",pos
8,cv893,26269,4,"now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker .",pos
8,cv893,26269,5,"i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection .",pos
8,cv893,26269,6,"problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail .",pos
8,cv893,26269,7,"so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ?",pos
8,cv893,26269,8,"truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches .",pos
8,cv893,26269,9,"yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from .",pos
8,cv893,26269,10,"as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos .",pos
8,cv893,26269,11,"as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring .",pos
8,cv893,26269,12,now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ?,pos
8,cv893,26269,13,"ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain .",pos
8,cv893,26269,14,throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ),pos
8,cv893,26269,15,into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city .,pos
8,cv893,26269,16,"how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ?",pos
8,cv893,26269,17,so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved .,pos
8,cv893,26269,18,"the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at .",pos
8,cv893,26269,19,"since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't .",pos
8,cv893,26269,20,( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) .,pos
8,cv893,26269,21,like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have .,pos
8,cv893,26269,22,( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) .,pos
8,cv893,26269,23,"here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) .",pos
8,cv893,26269,24,"williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york .",pos
8,cv893,26269,25,they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes .,pos
8,cv893,26269,26,and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done .,pos
8,cv893,26269,27,"the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice .",pos
8,cv893,26269,28,"danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way .",pos
8,cv893,26269,29,"he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" .",pos
8,cv893,26269,30,he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners .,pos
8,cv893,26269,31,right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do .,pos
8,cv893,26269,32,and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be .,pos
8,cv893,26269,33,"undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) .",pos
8,cv893,26269,34,"how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ?",pos
8,cv893,26269,35,"prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat .",pos
8,cv893,26269,36,"lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action .",pos
8,cv893,26269,37,"his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking .",pos
8,cv893,26269,38,lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension .,pos
8,cv893,26269,39,"this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching .",pos
8,cv893,26269,40,"though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot .",pos
8,cv893,26269,41,some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic .,pos
8,cv893,26269,42,hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable .,pos
8,cv893,26269,43,"of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on .",pos
8,cv893,26269,44,for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills .,pos
8,cv893,26269,45,"it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies .",pos
8,cv893,26269,46,"there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing .",pos
8,cv893,26269,47,"this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak .",pos
8,cv893,26269,48,"in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out .",pos
8,cv893,26269,49,he's lost his voice .,pos
8,cv893,26269,50,does that little itty bitty detail matter ?,pos
8,cv893,26269,51,"maybe not to most , but it sure made my night .",pos
8,cv893,26269,52,"and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .",pos
8,cv894,2068,0,"carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california .",pos
8,cv894,2068,1,"there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore , who is a city boy .",pos
8,cv894,2068,2,"when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled .",pos
8,cv894,2068,3,"dan gauthier , gugino's boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino .",pos
8,cv894,2068,4,gugino isn't ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore .,pos
8,cv894,2068,5,she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end .,pos
8,cv894,2068,6,"forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son-in-law is the film to see this summer .",pos
8,cv894,2068,7,"son-in-law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez .",pos
8,cv894,2068,8,"when son-in-law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then .",pos
8,cv894,2068,9,this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it .,pos
8,cv894,2068,10,nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen .,pos
8,cv894,2068,11,"although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch .",pos
8,cv894,2068,12,"the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around .",pos
8,cv894,2068,13,"the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old .",pos
8,cv894,2068,14,"there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven't seen before .",pos
8,cv894,2068,15,"still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still .",pos
8,cv894,2068,16,this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price .,pos
8,cv894,2068,17,the cast for this film does an excellent job .,pos
8,cv894,2068,18,pauly shore ( encino man ) is the star attraction of this film .,pos
8,cv894,2068,19,"he is great , and knows how to entertain the audience .",pos
8,cv894,2068,20,pauly shore just seems to take over the entire screen when he is on with expressions and comments that are hilarious .,pos
8,cv894,2068,21,this film would definitely not have been as good with anyone else in this role .,pos
8,cv894,2068,22,carla gugino does a very good job as the farm girl gone city girl .,pos
8,cv894,2068,23,"she makes her character believable , on some levels , yet interesting at the same time .",pos
8,cv894,2068,24,"the person who played the grandfather ( mason adams , i believe ) also does a great job .",pos
8,cv894,2068,25,the way he delivered his lines kept me laughing throughout the time that he was on the screen .,pos
8,cv894,2068,26,"patrick renna , who played gugino's little brother , was a little annoying , but no where as near as macaulay culkin , and for only part of the time , so i can forgive him .",pos
8,cv894,2068,27,"tiffani-amber thiessen ( a killer among friends , "" saved by the bell "" ) does a reasonably good job for the time that she is on screen .",pos
8,cv894,2068,28,she shows that she may have a potential in movies if she can get out of the corny young adults programming on television .,pos
8,cv894,2068,29,"she wasn't given overly much to do in the film , but what she had , she does a good job with .",pos

9,cv900,10331,26,this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this .,pos
9,cv900,10331,27,mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense .,pos
9,cv900,10331,28,all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp .,pos

9,cv900,10331,34,"the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes .",pos
9,cv900,10331,35,"now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end .",pos

9,cv902,12256,1,be forewarned .,pos
9,cv902,12256,2,"james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue .",pos
9,cv902,12256,3,"embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters .",pos
9,cv902,12256,4,"fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing .",pos
9,cv902,12256,5,"the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly .",pos
9,cv902,12256,6,"we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft .",pos
9,cv902,12256,7,"as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy .",pos
9,cv902,12256,8,"more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation .",pos
9,cv902,12256,9,it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride .,pos
9,cv902,12256,10,"played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights .",pos
9,cv902,12256,11,"it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour .",pos
9,cv902,12256,12,"whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful .",pos
9,cv902,12256,13,"though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly .",pos
9,cv902,12256,14,"( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag . )",pos
9,cv902,12256,15,"double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs .",pos
9,cv902,12256,16,"surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film .",pos
9,cv902,12256,17,"however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel .",pos
9,cv902,12256,18,"the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat .",pos
9,cv902,12256,19,"subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale .",pos
9,cv902,12256,20,one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla .,pos
9,cv902,12256,21,"two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious .",pos
9,cv902,12256,22,"if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film .",pos
9,cv902,12256,23,"he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered .",pos
9,cv902,12256,24,"it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance .",pos
9,cv902,12256,25,"while mr . downey jr . 's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles .",pos
9,cv902,12256,26,"ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman .",pos
9,cv902,12256,27,"she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry .",pos
9,cv902,12256,28,"meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing .",pos
9,cv902,12256,29,"she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox .",pos
9,cv902,12256,30,"the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout .",pos
9,cv902,12256,31,"two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors .",pos
9,cv902,12256,32,"while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner .",pos
9,cv902,12256,33,"two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it's still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends .",pos

9,cv903,17822,0,robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good .,pos
9,cv903,17822,1,"it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script .",pos
9,cv903,17822,2,"as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs .",pos
9,cv903,17822,3,"first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit .",pos
9,cv903,17822,4,"we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband .",pos
9,cv903,17822,5,we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) .,pos
9,cv903,17822,6,"then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live .",pos
9,cv903,17822,7,"we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop .",pos
9,cv903,17822,8,"we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion .",pos

9,cv903,17822,10,"she exclaims "" here i come ! """,pos

9,cv903,17822,12,"soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out .",pos
9,cv903,17822,13,"convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder .",pos
9,cv903,17822,14,"she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard .",pos
9,cv903,17822,15,"the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) .",pos
9,cv903,17822,16,"meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success .",pos
9,cv903,17822,17,"so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as "" a southern spin on fargo , "" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade .",pos
9,cv903,17822,18,"robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town .",pos
9,cv903,17822,19,"indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional .",pos
9,cv903,17822,20,"glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific "" aunt alexandria "" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity .",pos
9,cv903,17822,21,"the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill )",pos
9,cv903,17822,22,"there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends .",pos
9,cv903,17822,23,cookie's fortune is such a movie .,pos
9,cv903,17822,24,"i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter .",pos
9,cv903,17822,25,i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast .,pos

9,cv907,3541,20,analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ),pos
9,cv907,3541,21,what is behind the complex plot in exotica ?,pos
9,cv907,3541,22,"first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means .",pos
9,cv907,3541,23,"the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . .",pos
9,cv907,3541,24,"then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . .",pos
9,cv907,3541,25,"in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen .",pos
9,cv907,3541,26,"exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner .",pos
9,cv907,3541,27,"exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) .",pos
9,cv907,3541,28,"in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows .",pos
9,cv907,3541,29,"second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters .",pos
9,cv907,3541,30,"the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter .",pos

9,cv907,3541,32,"the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter .",pos
9,cv907,3541,33,"a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .",pos
9,cv908,16009,0,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again .",pos
9,cv908,16009,1,"and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) .",pos
9,cv908,16009,2,"this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite .",pos
9,cv908,16009,3,"contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 .",pos
9,cv908,16009,4,"this one , however , is shockingly not bad .",pos
9,cv908,16009,5,"in fact , it's actually good .",pos
9,cv908,16009,6,"not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining .",pos
9,cv908,16009,7,because it's cute and innocent fun .,pos
9,cv908,16009,8,because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with .,pos
9,cv908,16009,9,because the lead star is immensely appealing .,pos
9,cv908,16009,10,because the parents are also immensely appealing .,pos
9,cv908,16009,11,and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun .,pos
9,cv908,16009,12,"there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid .",pos
9,cv908,16009,13,"i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third .",pos
9,cv908,16009,14,"i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week .",pos
9,cv908,16009,15,"i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" ) .",pos
9,cv908,16009,16,"and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing .",pos
9,cv908,16009,17,"i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap . """,pos
9,cv908,16009,18,"it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version .",pos
9,cv908,16009,19,"it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it .",pos
9,cv908,16009,20,i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age .,pos
9,cv908,16009,21,"watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence .",pos
9,cv908,16009,22,"and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better .",pos
9,cv908,16009,23,"this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way .",pos
9,cv908,16009,24,"it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right .",pos
9,cv908,16009,25,the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way .,pos
9,cv908,16009,26,"and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults .",pos
9,cv908,16009,27,"the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents .",pos
9,cv908,16009,28,"one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer .",pos
9,cv908,16009,29,"she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing .",pos
9,cv908,16009,30,"the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming .",pos
9,cv908,16009,31,"they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged .",pos
9,cv908,16009,32,"they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin .",pos
9,cv908,16009,33,"there , they become friends , then learn about eachother .",pos
9,cv908,16009,34,"once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of .",pos
9,cv908,16009,35,"they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best .",pos
9,cv908,16009,36,lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original .,pos
9,cv908,16009,37,but she comes off just as appealing as she did once .,pos
9,cv908,16009,38,"she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively .",pos
9,cv908,16009,39,"she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect .",pos
9,cv908,16009,40,"she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films .",pos
9,cv908,16009,41,"she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing .",pos
9,cv908,16009,42,"dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan .",pos
9,cv908,16009,43,ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) .,pos
9,cv908,16009,44,"the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film .",pos
9,cv908,16009,45,"instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films .",pos
9,cv908,16009,46,"this all brings this new "" parent trap "" to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time .",pos
9,cv908,16009,47,"this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore .",pos
9,cv908,16009,48,"like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : "" it takes two "" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around .",pos
9,cv908,16009,49,"and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew .",pos
9,cv908,16009,50,"however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better .",pos
9,cv908,16009,51,"certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original .",pos
9,cv908,16009,52,"i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear .",pos
9,cv908,16009,53,"and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom .",pos
9,cv908,16009,54,"the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences .",pos
9,cv908,16009,55,"as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances .",pos

9,cv913,29252,0,"before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen .",pos
9,cv913,29252,1,this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone .,pos
9,cv913,29252,2,"i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again .",pos
9,cv913,29252,3,"i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s .",pos
9,cv913,29252,4,"in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me !",pos
9,cv913,29252,5,"if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying .",pos
9,cv913,29252,6,the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives .,pos
9,cv913,29252,7,"in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that .",pos
9,cv913,29252,8,"so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old .",pos
9,cv913,29252,9,plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator .,pos
9,cv913,29252,10,his methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date .,pos
9,cv913,29252,11,a new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency .,pos

9,cv913,29252,14,"soon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer .",pos
9,cv913,29252,15,"critique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline .",pos
9,cv913,29252,16,"on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy .",pos
9,cv913,29252,17,"the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man .",pos
9,cv913,29252,18,"but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick .",pos
9,cv913,29252,19,"i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) .",pos
9,cv913,29252,20,"of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude .",pos
9,cv913,29252,21,"he actually plays a "" macho "" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized .",pos
9,cv913,29252,22,"but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly "" sick of seeing "" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) .",pos
9,cv913,29252,23,"anyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue .",pos
9,cv913,29252,24,"i didn't care much for her running joke about him "" dying "" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum ,",pos

9,cv913,29252,26,"harumph , but i digress .",pos
9,cv913,29252,27,so let's recap .,pos
9,cv913,29252,28,"a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around .",pos
9,cv913,29252,29,"i can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through .",pos
9,cv913,29252,30,"it's probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , "" old-school "" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion .",pos

9,cv922,10073,35,"if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again .",pos
9,cv922,10073,36,"as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study .",pos
9,cv922,10073,37,"the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,38,"and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur .",pos
9,cv922,10073,39,it was at this point that i felt cheated .,pos
9,cv922,10073,40,"taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film .",pos
9,cv922,10073,41,everything occurs from his perspective .,pos
9,cv922,10073,42,he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .,pos
9,cv922,10073,43,but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game .,pos
9,cv922,10073,44,"i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself .",pos
9,cv922,10073,45,perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .,pos
9,cv922,10073,46,it earned its r rating for a reason .,pos
9,cv922,10073,47,"there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity .",pos
9,cv922,10073,48,"this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything .",pos
9,cv922,10073,49,"it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh .",pos
9,cv922,10073,50,"however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those .",pos
9,cv922,10073,51,"i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it .",pos
9,cv922,10073,52,the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .,pos
9,cv922,10073,53,"the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann .",pos
9,cv922,10073,54,"portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline .",pos
9,cv922,10073,55,"this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her .",pos
9,cv922,10073,56,"she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted .",pos
9,cv922,10073,57,"something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature .",pos
9,cv922,10073,58,the story actually has something to say about humanity .,pos
9,cv922,10073,59,"in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,60,he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .,pos
9,cv922,10073,61,"then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature .",pos
9,cv922,10073,62,this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .,pos
9,cv922,10073,63,"what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true .",pos
9,cv922,10073,64,"these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,65,"when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched .",pos
9,cv922,10073,66,"the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect .",pos
9,cv922,10073,67,"heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job .",pos
9,cv922,10073,68,probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .,pos
9,cv922,10073,69,"he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance .",pos
9,cv922,10073,70,i have never seen him more believable to date .,pos
9,cv922,10073,71,al pacino is of course the scene stealer .,pos
9,cv922,10073,72,his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .,pos
9,cv922,10073,73,"he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,74,jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .,pos
9,cv922,10073,75,judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past .,pos
9,cv922,10073,76,"connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times .",pos
9,cv922,10073,77,"one familiar face with a twist was "" coach "" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance .",pos
9,cv922,10073,78,"the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore .",pos
9,cv922,10073,79,"at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .",pos
9,cv922,10073,80,"for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters .",pos
9,cv922,10073,81,"the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score .",pos
9,cv922,10073,82,"director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes .",pos
9,cv922,10073,83,"i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time .",pos
9,cv922,10073,84,"but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream .",pos
9,cv922,10073,85,"personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .",pos
9,cv923,11051,0,"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church",pos
9,cv923,11051,1,synopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy .,pos
9,cv923,11051,2,"in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids .",pos
9,cv923,11051,3,"to atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station .",pos
9,cv923,11051,4,soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple .,pos
9,cv923,11051,5,but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him .,pos
9,cv923,11051,6,opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms .,pos
9,cv923,11051,7,"i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film .",pos
9,cv923,11051,8,"duvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs .",pos
9,cv923,11051,9,"incidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway .",pos
9,cv923,11051,10,"since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) .",pos
9,cv923,11051,11,"in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film .",pos
9,cv923,11051,12,"similarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience .",pos
9,cv923,11051,13,"on the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience .",pos
9,cv923,11051,14,"in terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone .",pos
9,cv923,11051,15,"teenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church .",pos
9,cv923,11051,16,"in other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience .",pos
9,cv924,29540,0,the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .,pos
9,cv924,29540,1,i mean that as the highest compliment .,pos
9,cv924,29540,2,"if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide .",pos
9,cv924,29540,3,"the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence .",pos
9,cv924,29540,4,"along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable .",pos
9,cv924,29540,5,"the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby .",pos
9,cv924,29540,6,"they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair .",pos
9,cv924,29540,7,"complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete .",pos
9,cv924,29540,8,"in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved .",pos
9,cv924,29540,9,"john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong .",pos
9,cv924,29540,10,"claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her .",pos
9,cv924,29540,11,"andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence .",pos
9,cv924,29540,12,"cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train .",pos
9,cv924,29540,13,"it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .",pos
9,cv924,29540,14,a pall is cast on the whole affair .,pos
9,cv924,29540,15,"a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments .",pos
9,cv924,29540,16,"in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love .",pos
9,cv924,29540,17,we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship .,pos
9,cv924,29540,18,"during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could .",pos
9,cv924,29540,19,all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates .,pos
9,cv924,29540,20,the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people .,pos
9,cv924,29540,21,"so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky .",pos
9,cv924,29540,22,or they're reduced to comedic buffoons .,pos
9,cv924,29540,23,"ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is .",pos
9,cv924,29540,24,"they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives .",pos
9,cv924,29540,25,"bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified .",pos
9,cv924,29540,26,norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept .,pos
9,cv924,29540,27,we feel for him .,pos
9,cv924,29540,28,he's a decent man .,pos
9,cv924,29540,29,"sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now .",pos
9,cv924,29540,30,"with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does .",pos
9,cv924,29540,31,"however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .",pos
9,cv925,8969,0,contact is a film that tries to do several different things .,pos
9,cv925,8969,1,"it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) .",pos
9,cv925,8969,2,the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals .,pos
9,cv925,8969,3,"the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files .",pos
9,cv925,8969,4,the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else .,pos
9,cv925,8969,5,"they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person .",pos
9,cv925,8969,6,"the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey .",pos
9,cv925,8969,7,"most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens .",pos
9,cv925,8969,8,"scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between .",pos
9,cv925,8969,9,"the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species .",pos
9,cv925,8969,10,"the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed .",pos
9,cv925,8969,11,"still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society .",pos
9,cv925,8969,12,"the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists .",pos
9,cv925,8969,13,"palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology .",pos
9,cv925,8969,14,"then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions .",pos
9,cv925,8969,15,"contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself .",pos
9,cv925,8969,16,the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss .,pos
9,cv925,8969,17,"for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction .",pos
9,cv925,8969,18,"the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development .",pos
9,cv925,8969,19,"instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments .",pos
9,cv925,8969,20,"granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else .",pos
9,cv925,8969,21,"the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures .",pos
9,cv925,8969,22,"even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film .",pos
9,cv925,8969,23,"contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable .",pos
9,cv925,8969,24,"and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .",pos
9,cv926,17059,0,"billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment .",pos
9,cv926,17059,1,"as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers .",pos
9,cv926,17059,2,"three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money .",pos
9,cv926,17059,3,jacob and lou want to pocket the cash .,pos
9,cv926,17059,4,"hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find .",pos
9,cv926,17059,5,"eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways .",pos
9,cv926,17059,6,"things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan .",pos
9,cv926,17059,7,disaster is sure to strike .,pos
9,cv926,17059,8,"director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name .",pos
9,cv926,17059,9,"while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come .",pos
9,cv926,17059,10,"scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension .",pos
9,cv926,17059,11,"while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter .",pos
9,cv926,17059,12,"alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character .",pos
9,cv926,17059,13,"danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score .",pos
9,cv926,17059,14,"if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long .",pos
9,cv926,17059,15,"just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further .",pos
9,cv926,17059,16,"while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) .",pos
9,cv926,17059,17,"the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife .",pos
9,cv926,17059,18,"this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films .",pos
9,cv926,17059,19,"fingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel .",pos

9,cv927,10681,12,"in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser .",pos

9,cv927,10681,14,the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character .,pos
9,cv927,10681,15,"on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts .",pos

9,cv927,10681,32,the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings .,pos
9,cv927,10681,33,"with the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight .",pos

9,cv928,9168,1,"in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film .",pos

9,cv928,9168,3,"in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker .",pos
9,cv928,9168,4,"unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film .",pos
9,cv928,9168,5,but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head .,pos
9,cv928,9168,6,"one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script .",pos
9,cv928,9168,7,"action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence .",pos
9,cv928,9168,8,"even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all .",pos
9,cv928,9168,9,the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s .,pos
9,cv928,9168,10,"the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day .",pos
9,cv928,9168,11,"the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall .",pos
9,cv928,9168,12,"i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes .",pos
9,cv928,9168,13,"this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) .",pos
9,cv928,9168,14,"if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) .",pos
9,cv928,9168,15,the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film .,pos
9,cv928,9168,16,"but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) .",pos

9,cv928,9168,36,"the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice .",pos
9,cv928,9168,37,"tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility .",pos
9,cv928,9168,38,i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water .,pos
9,cv928,9168,39,why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ?,pos

9,cv928,9168,41,"thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide .",pos
9,cv928,9168,42,"but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) .",pos
9,cv928,9168,43,"the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal .",pos

9,cv928,9168,45,"hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs .",pos

9,cv928,9168,47,"baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way .",pos
9,cv928,9168,48,"you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer .",pos
9,cv928,9168,49,"elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight .",pos
9,cv928,9168,50,"she isn't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model .",pos

9,cv930,13475,22,the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works .,pos
9,cv930,13475,23,"for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made .",pos
9,cv930,13475,24,"but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life .",pos

9,cv930,13475,26,the supporting actors also did a marvellous job .,pos
9,cv930,13475,27,sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters .,pos
9,cv930,13475,28,another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny .,pos
9,cv930,13475,29,"unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling .",pos

9,cv930,13475,31,"captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm .",pos
9,cv930,13475,32,"despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary .",pos
9,cv930,13475,33,"rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations .",pos

9,cv932,13401,9,"it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( "" beam me up scotty "" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) .",pos
9,cv932,13401,10,"i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year .",pos
9,cv932,13401,11,neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice .,pos
9,cv932,13401,12,"of course , you all know the story .",pos
9,cv932,13401,13,"when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) .",pos
9,cv932,13401,14,"in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters .",pos
9,cv932,13401,15,"belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's .",pos

9,cv932,13401,17,"he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver .",pos
9,cv932,13401,18,"then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie .",pos

9,cv932,13401,20,"as i said , this is hardly a film about plot .",pos
9,cv932,13401,21,it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden .,pos
9,cv932,13401,22,case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ?,pos
9,cv932,13401,23,"another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy .",pos

9,cv932,13401,27,did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ?,pos
9,cv932,13401,28,"but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies .",pos

9,cv933,23776,0,this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated .,pos
9,cv933,23776,1,"there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story .",pos
9,cv933,23776,2,"this is the best we've seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 ) .",pos
9,cv933,23776,3,this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story .,pos
9,cv933,23776,4,"in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives "" .",pos
9,cv933,23776,5,"one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him .",pos
9,cv933,23776,6,"woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards .",pos
9,cv933,23776,7,"later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room .",pos
9,cv933,23776,8,"since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back .",pos
9,cv933,23776,9,"although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale .",pos
9,cv933,23776,10,"the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody's roundup . """,pos
9,cv933,23776,11,"if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit .",pos
9,cv933,23776,12,"so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend .",pos
9,cv933,23776,13,"and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys .",pos
9,cv933,23776,14,"there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) .",pos
9,cv933,23776,15,"meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) .",pos
9,cv933,23776,16,"they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan .",pos
9,cv933,23776,17,"he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations .",pos
9,cv933,23776,18,"the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage .",pos
9,cv933,23776,19,a real effort is made in the technical department .,pos
9,cv933,23776,20,"the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the "" cinematography "" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression .",pos
9,cv933,23776,21,"lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on "" jurassic park "" and "" star wars "" .",pos
9,cv933,23776,22,"the film ends with the "" failed takes "" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv .",pos
9,cv933,23776,23,these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film .,pos
9,cv933,23776,24,"but what in the end makes "" toy story 2 "" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation .",pos
9,cv933,23776,25,"it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself .",pos
9,cv933,23776,26,"it is not difficult to predict that "" toy story 2 "" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected .",pos
9,cv933,23776,27,unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects .,pos
9,cv933,23776,28,but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs .,pos
9,cv933,23776,29,"but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years .",pos
9,cv933,23776,30,this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation .,pos
9,cv933,23776,31,"off course , this is not "" antz "" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have .",pos
9,cv933,23776,32,"whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say .",pos
9,cv933,23776,33,"my choice would probably be "" the iron giant "" , but ( along side with "" american pie "" ) this is the comedy of the year .",pos
9,cv933,23776,34,"i almost lost my hopes for disney , but "" toy story 2 "" proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain .",pos
9,cv934,19027,0,"not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies .",pos
9,cv934,19027,1,"if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way .",pos
9,cv934,19027,2,"this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie .",pos
9,cv934,19027,3,"gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it .",pos
9,cv934,19027,4,it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) .,pos
9,cv934,19027,5,"it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to "" sit for him , "" ( pose for a portrait ) .",pos
9,cv934,19027,6,"at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man .",pos
9,cv934,19027,7,"when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy .",pos
9,cv934,19027,8,"but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's "" locker room talk . """,pos
9,cv934,19027,9,"boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned "" locker room talk , "" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening .",pos
9,cv934,19027,10,"meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago .",pos
9,cv934,19027,11,"his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor .",pos
9,cv934,19027,12,"what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .",pos
9,cv934,19027,13,i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here .,pos
9,cv934,19027,14,"this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking .",pos
9,cv934,19027,15,"that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well .",pos
9,cv934,19027,16,this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn .,pos
9,cv934,19027,17,"he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem .",pos
9,cv934,19027,18,"whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield .",pos
9,cv934,19027,19,"he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people .",pos
9,cv934,19027,20,"in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .",pos

9,cv935,23841,0,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" .",pos

9,cv935,23841,2,"then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,3,"finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . .",pos
9,cv935,23841,4,there's a lot of flying going on in this film !,pos
9,cv935,23841,5,"as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in .",pos
9,cv935,23841,6,"well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released .",pos
9,cv935,23841,7,"part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) .",pos
9,cv935,23841,8,subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) .,pos
9,cv935,23841,9,"to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high .",pos
9,cv935,23841,10,"in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us .",pos
9,cv935,23841,11,"after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters .",pos
9,cv935,23841,12,is the format effective for the film ?,pos
9,cv935,23841,13,"with a few exceptions , yes .",pos
9,cv935,23841,14,the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony .,pos
9,cv935,23841,15,"it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily .",pos
9,cv935,23841,16,"everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts .",pos
9,cv935,23841,17,"eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things .",pos
9,cv935,23841,18,"though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies .",pos
9,cv935,23841,19,"the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,20,"in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape .",pos
9,cv935,23841,21,a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack .,pos
9,cv935,23841,22,"he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds .",pos
9,cv935,23841,23,"again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved .",pos
9,cv935,23841,24,"reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size .",pos
9,cv935,23841,25,"the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images .",pos
9,cv935,23841,26,one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent .,pos
9,cv935,23841,27,absolutely beautiful stuff .,pos
9,cv935,23841,28,"the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,29,"this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york .",pos
9,cv935,23841,30,"there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife .",pos
9,cv935,23841,31,"i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending .",pos
9,cv935,23841,32,"unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments .",pos
9,cv935,23841,33,"segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,34,"a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester .",pos
9,cv935,23841,35,the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina .,pos
9,cv935,23841,36,"little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from .",pos
9,cv935,23841,37,the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl .,pos
9,cv935,23841,38,"although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short .",pos
9,cv935,23841,39,"some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made .",pos
9,cv935,23841,40,segment five is the funniest of the bunch .,pos
9,cv935,23841,41,"set to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number .",pos
9,cv935,23841,42,"while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy .",pos
9,cv935,23841,43,"segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer's apprentice "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,44,"the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo .",pos
9,cv935,23841,45,"unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain .",pos
9,cv935,23841,46,there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain .,pos
9,cv935,23841,47,"similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters .",pos
9,cv935,23841,48,"segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character .",pos
9,cv935,23841,49,"donald duck "" stars "" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark .",pos
9,cv935,23841,50,"during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat .",pos
9,cv935,23841,51,they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners .,pos
9,cv935,23841,52,"despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days .",pos
9,cv935,23841,53,powerful stuff .,pos
9,cv935,23841,54,"segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? "" saving the best for last "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,55,"set to igor stravinsky's "" the firebird "" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape .",pos
9,cv935,23841,56,trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation .,pos
9,cv935,23841,57,"when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird .",pos
9,cv935,23841,58,"in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create .",pos
9,cv935,23841,59,"some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) .",pos
9,cv935,23841,60,"the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny .",pos
9,cv935,23841,61,be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin .,pos
9,cv935,23841,62,"penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting .",pos
9,cv935,23841,63,"the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board .",pos
9,cv935,23841,64,"pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's "" ride of the valkyries "" , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments .",pos
9,cv935,23841,65,"for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon .",pos
9,cv935,23841,66,the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material .,pos
9,cv935,23841,67,"as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters .",pos
9,cv935,23841,68,i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though .,pos

9,cv936,15954,1,"it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off .",pos

9,cv946,18658,1,review by matt pusateri,pos
9,cv946,18658,2,"few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars .",pos
9,cv946,18658,3,"the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture .",pos
9,cv946,18658,4,"arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb .",pos
9,cv946,18658,5,"so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ?",pos
9,cv946,18658,6,"can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ?",pos
9,cv946,18658,7,"against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week .",pos
9,cv946,18658,8,"and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment .",pos
9,cv946,18658,9,"while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking .",pos
9,cv946,18658,10,"it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films .",pos
9,cv946,18658,11,the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films .,pos
9,cv946,18658,12,"as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) .",pos
9,cv946,18658,13,the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation .,pos
9,cv946,18658,14,"the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) .",pos
9,cv946,18658,15,"later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice .",pos
9,cv946,18658,16,"on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts .",pos
9,cv946,18658,17,"qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force . """,pos
9,cv946,18658,18,"as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader .",pos
9,cv946,18658,19,"complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala .",pos
9,cv946,18658,20,"while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul .",pos
9,cv946,18658,21,"if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is .",pos
9,cv946,18658,22,"the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy .",pos
9,cv946,18658,23,but the complexity is not overwhelming .,pos
9,cv946,18658,24,"the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode .",pos
9,cv946,18658,25,"one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused .",pos
9,cv946,18658,26,it's unclear whose story phantom menace is .,pos
9,cv946,18658,27,"in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight .",pos
9,cv946,18658,28,but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's .,pos
9,cv946,18658,29,"if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation .",pos
9,cv946,18658,30,"lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive .",pos
9,cv946,18658,31,"on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one . """,pos
9,cv946,18658,32,"the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas .",pos
9,cv946,18658,33,neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight .,pos
9,cv946,18658,34,mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility .,pos
9,cv946,18658,35,"portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality .",pos
9,cv946,18658,36,"the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them .",pos
9,cv946,18658,37,"individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series .",pos
9,cv946,18658,38,"but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another .",pos
9,cv946,18658,39,"in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke .",pos
9,cv946,18658,40,the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities .,pos
9,cv946,18658,41,"in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other .",pos
9,cv946,18658,42,there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other .,pos
9,cv946,18658,43,"individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them .",pos
9,cv946,18658,44,"this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers .",pos
9,cv946,18658,45,"but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging .",pos
9,cv946,18658,46,many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining .,pos
9,cv946,18658,47,"first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates .",pos
9,cv946,18658,48,"the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council .",pos
9,cv946,18658,49,each location is elaborate and complex .,pos
9,cv946,18658,50,"lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines .",pos
9,cv946,18658,51,most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made .,pos
9,cv946,18658,52,"more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters .",pos
9,cv946,18658,53,"the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves .",pos
9,cv946,18658,54,"watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room .",pos
9,cv946,18658,55,"of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable .",pos
9,cv946,18658,56,"speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks .",pos
9,cv946,18658,57,"with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy .",pos
9,cv946,18658,58,"jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick .",pos
9,cv946,18658,59,"jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble .",pos
9,cv946,18658,60,"the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors .",pos
9,cv946,18658,61,"however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing .",pos
9,cv946,18658,62,he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene .,pos
9,cv946,18658,63,"throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence .",pos
9,cv946,18658,64,"you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character .",pos
9,cv946,18658,65,"initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film .",pos
9,cv946,18658,66,"on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all .",pos
9,cv946,18658,67,a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates .,pos
9,cv946,18658,68,"despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously .",pos
9,cv946,18658,69,"fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art .",pos
9,cv946,18658,70,"from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t .",pos
9,cv946,18658,71,"in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed .",pos
9,cv946,18658,72,"and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action .",pos
9,cv946,18658,73,"from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil .",pos
9,cv946,18658,74,"the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed .",pos
9,cv946,18658,75,the phantom menace won't win any major oscars .,pos
9,cv946,18658,76,it probably won't beat titanic's box office record .,pos
9,cv946,18658,77,"and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) .",pos
9,cv946,18658,78,"but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster .",pos
9,cv946,18658,79,"the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that .",pos
9,cv946,18658,80,but it's still worth seeing . . .,pos
9,cv946,18658,81,probably more than once .,pos
9,cv947,10601,0,"the premise is simple , if not bizarre .",pos
9,cv947,10601,1,a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made .,pos
9,cv947,10601,2,why ?,pos
9,cv947,10601,3,"it's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun .",pos
9,cv947,10601,4,"based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely .",pos
9,cv947,10601,5,"mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies .",pos
9,cv947,10601,6,"the catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live .",pos
9,cv947,10601,7,"dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema .",pos
9,cv947,10601,8,the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man .,pos
9,cv947,10601,9,"we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them .",pos
9,cv947,10601,10,"in this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth .",pos
9,cv947,10601,11,"we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary .",pos
9,cv947,10601,12,"the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one .",pos
9,cv947,10601,13,"this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth .",pos
9,cv947,10601,14,together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet .,pos
9,cv947,10601,15,"to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .",pos
9,cv947,10601,16,"mst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken .",pos
9,cv947,10601,17,"as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long .",pos
9,cv947,10601,18,occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously .,pos
9,cv947,10601,19,"although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste .",pos
9,cv947,10601,20,"mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment .",pos
9,cv947,10601,21,"although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it .",pos
9,cv947,10601,22,"warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most .",pos
9,cv947,10601,23,"the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience .",pos
9,cv947,10601,24,"most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .",pos

9,cv948,24606,1,"any meaning found in the underground is usually lost by the dumbing-down of the experience to make it "" more accessible "" to the general public .",pos

9,cv953,6836,26,"however , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself .",pos

9,cv954,18628,3,"life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel .",pos
9,cv954,18628,4,"director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up .",pos

9,cv954,18628,6,"amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other .",pos
9,cv954,18628,7,"as the movie opens , we're introduced to ray gibson ( eddie murphy ) , a two-timing pickpocket who schmoozes his way into a club .",pos

9,cv954,18628,12,"the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude .",pos
9,cv954,18628,13,"luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner .",pos
9,cv954,18628,14,"not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too .",pos
9,cv954,18628,15,"murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards .",pos
9,cv954,18628,16,this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve .,pos
9,cv954,18628,17,"while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core .",pos
9,cv954,18628,18,"but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars .",pos
9,cv954,18628,19,"the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight .",pos
9,cv954,18628,20,"i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to .",pos
9,cv954,18628,21,"it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll .",pos
9,cv955,25001,0,"cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film .",pos
9,cv955,25001,1,"a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's "" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking .",pos
9,cv955,25001,2,"yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness .",pos
9,cv955,25001,3,the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft .,pos
9,cv955,25001,4,"while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass .",pos
9,cv955,25001,5,this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is .,pos
9,cv955,25001,6,"much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers .",pos
9,cv955,25001,7,"contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff .",pos
9,cv955,25001,8,"the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city .",pos
9,cv955,25001,9,"however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors .",pos
9,cv955,25001,10,"when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i .",pos
9,cv955,25001,11,"but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime .",pos
9,cv955,25001,12,"peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film .",pos
9,cv955,25001,13,"peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages .",pos
9,cv955,25001,14,"however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) .",pos
9,cv955,25001,15,"it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless .",pos
9,cv955,25001,16,"then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars .",pos
9,cv955,25001,17,"bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on .",pos
9,cv955,25001,18,"collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane .",pos
9,cv955,25001,19,busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan .,pos
9,cv955,25001,20,"registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno .",pos
9,cv955,25001,21,"( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . )",pos
9,cv955,25001,22,that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director .,pos
9,cv955,25001,23,this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases .,pos
9,cv955,25001,24,they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them .,pos
9,cv955,25001,25,"these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional .",pos
9,cv955,25001,26,"but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive .",pos
9,cv955,25001,27,"from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado .",pos
9,cv955,25001,28,"even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary .",pos
9,cv955,25001,29,"style doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence .",pos
9,cv955,25001,30,"what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth .",pos
9,cv956,11609,0,"uncompromising french director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur . """,pos
9,cv956,11609,1,"instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them .",pos
9,cv956,11609,2,"chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal .",pos
9,cv956,11609,3,"bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood .",pos
9,cv956,11609,4,bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure .,pos
9,cv956,11609,5,"the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house .",pos
9,cv956,11609,6,"since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films .",pos
9,cv956,11609,7,"we never get to see camelot at the peak of its power , therefore there is no real downfall to witness .",pos
9,cv956,11609,8,"but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film .",pos
9,cv956,11609,9,"rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom .",pos
9,cv956,11609,10,"lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh .",pos
9,cv956,11609,11,"the greatest of all knights , he was flawed only in his love for arthur's wife , queen guinevere , and it was that illicit affair that eventually caused the downfall of camelot .",pos
9,cv956,11609,12,"even when lancelot attempts to end the affair with guinevere ( laura duke condominas ) , he only finds himself falling back into her arms against his better judgment .",pos
9,cv956,11609,13,"he knows it means the destruction of the idealized kingdom , but he is powerless in his passion .",pos
9,cv956,11609,14,"when sir mordred ( patrick bernhard ) accuses lancelot of the affair , other knights , including sir gawain ( humbert balsan ) spring to lancelot's defense .",pos
9,cv956,11609,15,"it is this battle within the knights that is the eventual undoing of the round table ; the flesh wins out over the spirit , and the consequences are dire .",pos
9,cv956,11609,16,bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds .,pos
9,cv956,11609,17,""" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music .",pos
9,cv956,11609,18,"he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits .",pos
9,cv956,11609,19,"the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest .",pos
9,cv956,11609,20,"like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices .",pos
9,cv956,11609,21,"all the actors he used in "" lancelot of the lake "" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again .",pos
9,cv956,11609,22,never once do they raise their voices or put any emphasis on a given word .,pos
9,cv956,11609,23,"instead of using vocal inflection , bresson strove to create emotion through images .",pos
9,cv956,11609,24,"in some ways , this technique works ; in other ways , it doesn't .",pos
9,cv956,11609,25,"the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment .",pos

9,cv958,12162,1,"bille august's high-profile adaptation of victor hugo's classic les miserables delivers everything one would expect from a classy hollywood epic--handsome production values , strong performances by a top-notch cast , a literate screenplay--with one critically missing element : emotional sweep .",pos
9,cv958,12162,2,"for those not familiar with hugo's original novel or the hit stage musical it inspired , the hook of les miserables essentially boils down to something like a 19th-century french-set version of the fugitive .",pos

9,cv958,12162,13,"neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role .",pos
9,cv958,12162,14,the younger members of the cast fare less well .,pos
9,cv958,12162,15,"danes is convincing as cosette , but her overdone lip quivering during her crying scenes becomes a distraction ; and matheson , while competent , is a less interesting robert sean leonard .",pos

9,cv958,12162,17,"while i was touched by valjean's relationships with fantine and cosette , i was not moved .",pos

9,cv958,12162,19,"my only previous experience with les miserables is with the musical ( as i am sure many others' is ) , and i was dismayed to see eponine , a friend of marius's who selflessly dies in the name of her unspoken love for him , almost completely jettisoned from this adaptation ( the daughter of the thenardiers , here she is only briefly seen as a child ) .",pos
9,cv958,12162,20,"her presence would have added some much-needed conflict and emotional heft to the youthful romance , but i suppose august and yglesias felt one tragic heroine ( fantine ) was enough .",pos

9,cv959,14611,19,"the plot also side-tracks into a silly cocaine dealing bust , which seemed out of place in this movie .",pos
9,cv959,14611,20,"finally , their are almost too many characters in the film , and despite the running time , the film never really spends enough time on them .",pos
9,cv959,14611,21,"some of the characters are very slight , which is a shame .",pos
9,cv959,14611,22,"the conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough .",pos
9,cv959,14611,23,"but despite these qualms , the last days of disco is a funny , warm movie , which is certainly worth seeing , and is a fitting homage to the disco era of the 80's .",pos

9,cv963,6895,3,"as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers .",pos
9,cv963,6895,4,"but oh , how differently the packages affect their films .",pos
9,cv963,6895,5,"while "" everyone's "" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is .",pos
9,cv963,6895,6,"i left "" everyone says i love you "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face .",pos
9,cv963,6895,7,"i left "" the portrait of a lady "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less .",pos
9,cv963,6895,8,""" everyone "" features nothing allen hasn't done before storywise .",pos
9,cv963,6895,9,"woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again .",pos
9,cv963,6895,10,similar situations happen to his family and friends .,pos
9,cv963,6895,11,"some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his "" early , funny "" films .",pos
9,cv963,6895,12,"the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of "" take the money and run , "" his directorial debut .",pos
9,cv963,6895,13,"however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits .",pos
9,cv963,6895,14,"in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important .",pos
9,cv963,6895,15,"yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story .",pos
9,cv963,6895,16,but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling .,pos
9,cv963,6895,17,and what better way to express feeling than through music ?,pos
9,cv963,6895,18,"love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart .",pos
9,cv963,6895,19,"some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there .",pos
9,cv963,6895,20,"it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him .",pos
9,cv963,6895,21,"their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) .",pos
9,cv963,6895,22,"but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience .",pos
9,cv963,6895,23,"granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders .",pos
9,cv963,6895,24,"jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in "" portrait of a lady , "" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one .",pos
9,cv963,6895,25,campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind .,pos
9,cv963,6895,26,"unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting .",pos
9,cv963,6895,27,"i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people .",pos
9,cv963,6895,28,"even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten .",pos
9,cv963,6895,29,"the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material .",pos
9,cv963,6895,30,it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone .,pos
9,cv963,6895,31,"the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them .",pos
9,cv963,6895,32,"i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives .",pos
9,cv963,6895,33,jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity .,pos
9,cv963,6895,34,"in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes .",pos
9,cv963,6895,35,"unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film .",pos
9,cv963,6895,36,"in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it .",pos
9,cv963,6895,37,"so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them .",pos
9,cv963,6895,38,why ?,pos
9,cv963,6895,39,"with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only "" everyone says i love you "" was able to make my heart sing .",pos
9,cv964,6021,0,you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk .,pos
9,cv964,6021,1,the title is generic .,pos
9,cv964,6021,2,it's meaningless .,pos
9,cv964,6021,3,and i can't believe it's good business .,pos
9,cv964,6021,4,"when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ?",pos
9,cv964,6021,5,yuck .,pos
9,cv964,6021,6,the movie itself deserves your attention .,pos
9,cv964,6021,7,"for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down .",pos
9,cv964,6021,8,"only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution .",pos
9,cv964,6021,9,"much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero .",pos
9,cv964,6021,10,"his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold .",pos
9,cv964,6021,11,"in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target .",pos
9,cv964,6021,12,"( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released . )",pos
9,cv964,6021,13,"this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings .",pos
9,cv964,6021,14,the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow .,pos
9,cv964,6021,15,here's the rundown .,pos
9,cv964,6021,16,van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double .,pos
9,cv964,6021,17,"turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) .",pos
9,cv964,6021,18,alain does some investigating .,pos
9,cv964,6021,19,"he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia .",pos
9,cv964,6021,20,"assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa .",pos
9,cv964,6021,21,that's as much as you need to know .,pos
9,cv964,6021,22,"the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment .",pos
9,cv964,6021,23,"there's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) .",pos
9,cv964,6021,24,"she's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as "" acting . """,pos
9,cv964,6021,25,"of course , "" acting "" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's ) .",pos
9,cv964,6021,26,"the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity .",pos
9,cv964,6021,27,( keep that in mind when planning your date . ),pos
9,cv964,6021,28,"the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive .",pos
9,cv964,6021,29,"there's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies .",pos
9,cv964,6021,30,"and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action .",pos
9,cv964,6021,31,"the main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run .",pos
9,cv964,6021,32,"don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment .",pos
9,cv964,6021,33,but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood .,pos
9,cv964,6021,34,"( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! )",pos
9,cv964,6021,35,"while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture .",pos
9,cv964,6021,36,"the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on .",pos
9,cv964,6021,37,"the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action .",pos
9,cv964,6021,38,"the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre .",pos
9,cv964,6021,39,"the story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had .",pos
9,cv964,6021,40,"but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity .",pos
9,cv964,6021,41,"van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid .",pos
9,cv965,26071,0,"in many ways , "" twotg "" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories .",pos
9,cv965,26071,1,there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold .,pos
9,cv965,26071,2,"but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us "" the usual suspects "" .",pos
9,cv965,26071,3,his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry .,pos
9,cv965,26071,4,the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) .,pos
9,cv965,26071,5,these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough .,pos
9,cv965,26071,6,their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive .,pos
9,cv965,26071,7,"given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter .",pos
9,cv965,26071,8,"yet , they are incredibly foolish planners .",pos
9,cv965,26071,9,"actually , these two never really have a plan .",pos
9,cv965,26071,10,"they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked .",pos
9,cv965,26071,11,"their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family .",pos
9,cv965,26071,12,"if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on .",pos
9,cv965,26071,13,"what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss .",pos
9,cv965,26071,14,"moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her .",pos
9,cv965,26071,15,these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations .,pos
9,cv965,26071,16,they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high .,pos
9,cv965,26071,17,"but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways .",pos
9,cv965,26071,18,"the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation .",pos
9,cv965,26071,19,"during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed .",pos
9,cv965,26071,20,"because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome .",pos
9,cv965,26071,21,we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause .,pos
9,cv965,26071,22,"as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge .",pos
9,cv965,26071,23,"the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur .",pos
9,cv965,26071,24,"the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money .",pos
9,cv965,26071,25,you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement .,pos
9,cv965,26071,26,"in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it .",pos
9,cv965,26071,27,"yet , for the most part , "" the way of the gun "" stays on target .",pos
9,cv965,26071,28,"it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry .",pos

9,cv967,5788,12,"just the idea of a witch heroine may scare away some audiences , but no mention is made of the occult , and the subject is dealt with harmlessly throughout the movie : kiki's mother acts as a village doctor , and kiki is able to do no more than fly on a broom .",pos

9,cv967,5788,22,"the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's .",pos

9,cv967,5788,34,"the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes .",pos

9,cv973,10066,12,"after dinner , john witnesses a telephone conversation between jeff and beatrice , and is at the same time amazed and sickened by how hunky-dory the dialog is .",pos
9,cv973,10066,13,"in comparison , beatrice always hints at a fault in john and his career every time she talks with him , and john gives it right back to her .",pos
9,cv973,10066,14,"at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,15,"the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading .",pos
9,cv973,10066,16,"it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,17,it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy .,pos
9,cv973,10066,18,there's always the big but .,pos
9,cv973,10066,19,"john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner .",pos
9,cv973,10066,20,"he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is .",pos
9,cv973,10066,21,""" a great experiment "" , he calls it .",pos
9,cv973,10066,22,"brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother .",pos
9,cv973,10066,23,"there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,24,"she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious .",pos
9,cv973,10066,25,"in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh .",pos
9,cv973,10066,26,she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over .,pos
9,cv973,10066,27,"when john points out the ice on the sherbet , beatrice tells him not to worry about the protective glaze .",pos
9,cv973,10066,28,""" you've named the ice ? """,pos
9,cv973,10066,29,asks john .,pos
9,cv973,10066,30,"he's also surprised at the variety of items beatrice keeps in the refrigerator , such as a twenty-pound block of cheese .",pos

9,cv973,10066,32,"that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,33,it's something most of us find strangely familiar .,pos
9,cv973,10066,34,brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur .,pos
9,cv973,10066,35,"for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion .",pos
9,cv973,10066,36,"when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , "" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! """,pos
9,cv973,10066,37,"you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context .",pos
9,cv973,10066,38,"in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene .",pos
9,cv973,10066,39,"i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past .",pos
9,cv973,10066,40,"john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him .",pos
9,cv973,10066,41,"his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth .",pos
9,cv973,10066,42,watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way .,pos
9,cv973,10066,43,"on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world .",pos
9,cv973,10066,44,"in a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude .",pos
9,cv973,10066,45,casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect .,pos
9,cv973,10066,46,"she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character .",pos
9,cv973,10066,47,this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her .,pos
9,cv973,10066,48,"as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease .",pos
9,cv973,10066,49,"that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely .",pos
9,cv973,10066,50,"rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy .",pos
9,cv973,10066,51,the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes .,pos
9,cv973,10066,52,a solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother .,pos
9,cv973,10066,53,"additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? :",pos
9,cv973,10066,54,beatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron .,pos
9,cv973,10066,55,"john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron .",pos
9,cv973,10066,56,"beatrice : well , it takes one to know one .",pos
9,cv974,22941,0,"( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course )",pos
9,cv974,22941,1,"we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world .",pos
9,cv974,22941,2,"and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) .",pos
9,cv974,22941,3,"no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat .",pos
9,cv974,22941,4,"about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' .",pos
9,cv974,22941,5,"the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry .",pos
9,cv974,22941,6,she can't go higher than him .,pos
9,cv974,22941,7,he won't allow it .,pos
9,cv974,22941,8,"and what's amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor .",pos
9,cv974,22941,9,"early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher .",pos
9,cv974,22941,10,"it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist .",pos
9,cv974,22941,11,"and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters .",pos
9,cv974,22941,12,"it's with mandy barnett's "" if you'll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony .",pos
9,cv974,22941,13,"sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success .",pos
9,cv974,22941,14,"it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries .",pos
9,cv974,22941,15,"satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not .",pos
9,cv974,22941,16,"it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) .",pos
9,cv974,22941,17,"payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart .",pos
9,cv974,22941,18,"we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about .",pos
9,cv974,22941,19,"minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller's day off "" .",pos
9,cv974,22941,20,whatever .,pos
9,cv975,10981,0,martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me .,pos
9,cv975,10981,1,"because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks .",pos
9,cv975,10981,2,"as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something .",pos
9,cv975,10981,3,i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story .,pos
9,cv975,10981,4,no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies .,pos
9,cv975,10981,5,"for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other .",pos
9,cv975,10981,6,there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on .,pos
9,cv975,10981,7,"or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building .",pos
9,cv975,10981,8,"again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing .",pos
9,cv975,10981,9,i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking .,pos
9,cv975,10981,10,but he simply uses the best tool for the job .,pos
9,cv975,10981,11,"it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward .",pos
9,cv975,10981,12,"the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet .",pos
9,cv975,10981,13,"the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . """,pos
9,cv975,10981,14,his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story .,pos
9,cv975,10981,15,( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ),pos
9,cv975,10981,16,we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old .,pos
9,cv975,10981,17,his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama .,pos
9,cv975,10981,18,a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before .,pos
9,cv975,10981,19,several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items .,pos
9,cv975,10981,20,the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own .,pos
9,cv975,10981,21,"the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama .",pos
9,cv975,10981,22,scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk .,pos
9,cv975,10981,23,"before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation .",pos
9,cv975,10981,24,"sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice .",pos
9,cv975,10981,25,"either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader .",pos
9,cv975,10981,26,">from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation .",pos
9,cv975,10981,27,it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child .,pos
9,cv975,10981,28,in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services .,pos
9,cv975,10981,29,but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage .,pos
9,cv975,10981,30,"neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person .",pos
9,cv975,10981,31,certain patterns take shape over the years .,pos
9,cv975,10981,32,"for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology .",pos
9,cv975,10981,33,"radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys .",pos
9,cv975,10981,34,"when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet .",pos
9,cv975,10981,35,"he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals .",pos
9,cv975,10981,36,it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter .,pos
9,cv975,10981,37,"but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china .",pos
9,cv975,10981,38,"tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border .",pos
9,cv975,10981,39,the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays .,pos
9,cv975,10981,40,"the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india .",pos
9,cv975,10981,41,the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do .,pos
9,cv975,10981,42,it just doesn't fit that mold .,pos
9,cv975,10981,43,"if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) .",pos
9,cv975,10981,44,the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that .,pos
9,cv975,10981,45,"the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa .",pos
9,cv975,10981,46,"perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet .",pos
9,cv975,10981,47,"a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie .",pos
9,cv975,10981,48,the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold .,pos
9,cv975,10981,49,"the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans .",pos
9,cv975,10981,50,even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet .,pos
9,cv975,10981,51,"philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice .",pos
9,cv975,10981,52,"for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala .",pos
9,cv975,10981,53,"his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns .",pos
9,cv975,10981,54,these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition .,pos
9,cv975,10981,55,"people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music .",pos
9,cv975,10981,56,it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person .,pos
9,cv975,10981,57,"on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .",pos
9,cv976,10267,0,robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often .,pos
9,cv976,10267,1,it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years .,pos
9,cv976,10267,2,"until 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time .",pos
9,cv976,10267,3,"the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching .",pos
9,cv976,10267,4,"a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because "" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . """,pos
9,cv976,10267,5,"all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy .",pos
9,cv976,10267,6,it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears .,pos
9,cv976,10267,7,"but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry .",pos
9,cv976,10267,8,upon my first viewing i left bawling .,pos
9,cv976,10267,9,"it is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can't help but be effected .",pos
9,cv976,10267,10,"the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films .",pos
9,cv976,10267,11,"martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world .",pos
9,cv976,10267,12,that is what a river runs through it does .,pos
9,cv976,10267,13,it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self .,pos
9,cv976,10267,14,"both times i've seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up .",pos
9,cv976,10267,15,but the dream is lovely .,pos
9,cv977,4938,0,richard gere is not one of my favorite actors .,pos
9,cv977,4938,1,"however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on .",pos
9,cv977,4938,2,i wasn't disappointed .,pos
9,cv977,4938,3,"it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns .",pos
9,cv977,4938,4,one thing : what's with the title ?,pos
9,cv977,4938,5,"not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine .",pos
9,cv977,4938,6,"in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it .",pos
9,cv977,4938,7,martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney .,pos
9,cv977,4938,8,"he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers .",pos
9,cv977,4938,9,"once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get .",pos

9,cv977,4938,11,"vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) .",pos
9,cv977,4938,12,"there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces .",pos
9,cv977,4938,13,"we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail .",pos
9,cv977,4938,14,richard gere does a fairly good job .,pos
9,cv977,4938,15,"at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth .",pos

9,cv979,18921,22,"screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans .",pos
9,cv979,18921,23,"sympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them .",pos
9,cv979,18921,24,"i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works .",pos
9,cv979,18921,25,i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs .,pos

9,cv979,18921,32,"luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable .",pos
9,cv979,18921,33,"with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes .",pos
9,cv979,18921,34,"i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate .",pos

9,cv988,18740,2,"this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video .",pos
9,cv988,18740,3,"what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals .",pos
9,cv988,18740,4,"basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets .",pos

9,cv988,18740,9,"however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy .",pos
9,cv988,18740,10,"meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders .",pos
9,cv988,18740,11,"there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb .",pos
9,cv988,18740,12,this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made .,pos
9,cv988,18740,13,"in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes .",pos
9,cv988,18740,14,"despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws .",pos
9,cv988,18740,15,"for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience .",pos
9,cv988,18740,16,what a klutz !,pos
9,cv988,18740,17,"george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain .",pos
9,cv988,18740,18,"secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments .",pos
9,cv988,18740,19,"this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here .",pos

9,cv992,11962,48,"the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad .",pos
9,cv992,11962,49,"but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,50,"also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off .",pos

9,cv992,11962,56,my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store .,pos
9,cv992,11962,57,i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) .,pos
9,cv992,11962,58,the acting is quite good for this kind of film .,pos
9,cv992,11962,59,"it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least .",pos
9,cv992,11962,60,"the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens .",pos
9,cv992,11962,61,"okay , so it isn't that good .",pos
9,cv992,11962,62,"george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting .",pos

9,cv993,29737,5,i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place .,pos
9,cv993,29737,6,"the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of , well . . . the",pos

9,cv993,29737,8,"of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either .",pos
9,cv993,29737,9,"and therein , lies the fun of the film .",pos
9,cv993,29737,10,do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ?,pos
9,cv993,29737,11,"well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another .",pos
9,cv993,29737,12,"and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades .",pos
9,cv993,29737,13,"hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these "" commercial "" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top .",pos

9,cv993,29737,15,"he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more .",pos

9,cv993,29737,17,"the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you",pos
9,cv993,29737,18,"have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major "" coincidence "" which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too "" convenient "" for my taste .",pos
9,cv993,29737,19,"i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene .",pos
9,cv993,29737,20,"but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts .",pos
9,cv993,29737,21,"see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie .",pos

9,cv994,12270,13,"it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) .",pos
9,cv994,12270,14,i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) .,pos
9,cv994,12270,15,"he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as "" best villain "" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) .",pos

1,cv100,12406,2,"deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 .",neg
1,cv100,12406,3,remember when dante's peak came out in february ?,neg
1,cv100,12406,4,"a few months later , volcano was released .",neg
1,cv100,12406,5,"the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen .",neg
1,cv100,12406,6,the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .,neg
1,cv100,12406,7,"well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .",neg
1,cv100,12406,8,"this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july .",neg
1,cv100,12406,9,"of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak .",neg
1,cv100,12406,10,"but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .",neg
1,cv100,12406,11,"apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me .",neg
1,cv100,12406,12,"to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .",neg
1,cv100,12406,13,"volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .",neg
1,cv100,12406,14,"deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .",neg
1,cv100,12406,15,the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .,neg
1,cv100,12406,16,"deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .",neg
1,cv100,12406,17,"a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .",neg

1,cv100,12406,30,beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .,neg
1,cv100,12406,31,"naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .",neg
1,cv100,12406,32,"and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .",neg
1,cv100,12406,33,"they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival .",neg
1,cv100,12406,34,"a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random .",neg
1,cv100,12406,35,these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race .,neg
1,cv100,12406,36,"after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .",neg
1,cv100,12406,37,"the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .",neg
1,cv100,12406,38,"jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .",neg
1,cv100,12406,39,the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .,neg
1,cv100,12406,40,it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .,neg
1,cv100,12406,41,"now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .",neg
1,cv100,12406,42,"the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !",neg
1,cv100,12406,43,"by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work .",neg
1,cv100,12406,44,"director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er . """,neg
1,cv100,12406,45,"her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .",neg
1,cv100,12406,46,"well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .",neg
1,cv100,12406,47,"suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .",neg
1,cv100,12406,48,"much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off .",neg
1,cv100,12406,49,throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .,neg
1,cv100,12406,50,it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring .,neg
1,cv100,12406,51,"of course , leder isn't all to blame for it .",neg
1,cv100,12406,52,screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .,neg
1,cv100,12406,53,what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .,neg
1,cv100,12406,54,"chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" )",neg
1,cv100,12406,55,"and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again .",neg
1,cv100,12406,56,"only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring .",neg
1,cv100,12406,57,"and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi .",neg
1,cv100,12406,58,to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .,neg
1,cv100,12406,59,"that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit .",neg
1,cv100,12406,60,"scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .",neg
1,cv100,12406,61,"but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .",neg
1,cv100,12406,62,"the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable .",neg
1,cv100,12406,63,what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .,neg
1,cv100,12406,64,"give me a break , will ya ?",neg
1,cv100,12406,65,"and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .",neg
1,cv100,12406,66,"well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .",neg
1,cv100,12406,67,"the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .",neg
1,cv100,12406,68,"cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .",neg
1,cv100,12406,69,"in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .",neg
1,cv100,12406,70,"just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .",neg
1,cv100,12406,71,"one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors .",neg
1,cv100,12406,72,leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror .,neg
1,cv100,12406,73,"this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .",neg
1,cv100,12406,74,but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .,neg
1,cv100,12406,75,"leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .",neg
1,cv100,12406,76,one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .,neg
1,cv100,12406,77,"this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space .",neg
1,cv100,12406,78,"this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .",neg
1,cv100,12406,79,"on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .",neg
1,cv100,12406,80,"the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .",neg
1,cv100,12406,81,"then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional .",neg
1,cv100,12406,82,"it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters , but it didn't work for me .",neg
1,cv100,12406,83,"but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .",neg
1,cv100,12406,84,"t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .",neg
1,cv100,12406,85,"her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her .",neg
1,cv100,12406,86,"robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .",neg
1,cv100,12406,87,"elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !",neg
1,cv100,12406,88,you are too talented for this stuff ) .,neg
1,cv100,12406,89,"vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .",neg
1,cv100,12406,90,"maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .",neg
1,cv100,12406,91,"morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .",neg
1,cv100,12406,92,"leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .",neg
1,cv100,12406,93,a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .,neg
1,cv100,12406,94,"eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .",neg
1,cv100,12406,95,"crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's "" star trek : the next generation . """,neg
1,cv100,12406,96,seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .,neg
1,cv100,12406,97,"overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .",neg
1,cv100,12406,98,deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .,neg
1,cv100,12406,99,"this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .",neg
1,cv100,12406,100,"luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .",neg
1,cv100,12406,101,it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much .,neg
1,cv100,12406,102,"costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .",neg
1,cv100,12406,103,"well , it's not .",neg
1,cv100,12406,104,"when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .",neg
1,cv101,10537,0,my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list .,neg
1,cv101,10537,1,what an auspicious beginning !,neg
1,cv101,10537,2,welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere .,neg
1,cv101,10537,3,"firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies .",neg
1,cv101,10537,4,"as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . """,neg
1,cv101,10537,5,"we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan . """,neg

1,cv101,10537,7,"when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble .",neg
1,cv101,10537,8,"with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles .",neg
1,cv101,10537,9,"not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people .",neg
1,cv101,10537,10,"miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away .",neg
1,cv101,10537,11,"in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building .",neg
1,cv101,10537,12,"as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face .",neg
1,cv101,10537,13,"our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl .",neg
1,cv101,10537,14,in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames .,neg

1,cv101,10537,17,the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group .,neg

1,cv101,10537,20,"yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway .",neg
1,cv101,10537,21,"not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape .",neg
1,cv101,10537,22,"( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . )",neg

1,cv101,10537,24,most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing .,neg
1,cv101,10537,25,he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck .,neg
1,cv101,10537,26,arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside .,neg

1,cv101,10537,29,editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions .,neg
1,cv101,10537,30,"the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie .",neg
1,cv101,10537,31,"perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , "" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . """,neg
1,cv101,10537,32,firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 .,neg
1,cv101,10537,33,it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .,neg
1,cv102,8306,0,"ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .",neg
1,cv102,8306,1,these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .,neg
1,cv102,8306,2,"if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .",neg

1,cv102,8306,7,"well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : "" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology "" .",neg
1,cv102,8306,8,"and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .",neg
1,cv102,8306,9,"the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .",neg

1,cv102,8306,17,"really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said .",neg
1,cv102,8306,18,"it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .",neg

1,cv120,3793,9,"captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while "" slightly "" misguided , is good at heart .",neg

1,cv120,3793,16,"the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch .",neg

1,cv120,3793,23,perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history .,neg
1,cv120,3793,24,"it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled .",neg

1,cv120,3793,26,"as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film .",neg

1,cv120,3793,28,"if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this .",neg

1,cv120,3793,30,"i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway .",neg

1,cv138,13903,0,my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love .,neg
1,cv138,13903,1,i love ralph fiennes .,neg

1,cv138,13903,5,"i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since .",neg
1,cv138,13903,6,"a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground .",neg
1,cv138,13903,7,"then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .",neg
1,cv138,13903,8,and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .,neg
1,cv138,13903,9,and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .,neg
1,cv138,13903,10,my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .,neg
1,cv138,13903,11,the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations .,neg

1,cv138,13903,14,"but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .",neg
1,cv138,13903,15,"that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .",neg
1,cv138,13903,16,"it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .",neg
1,cv138,13903,17,"it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .",neg
1,cv138,13903,18,this is just plain depressing .,neg
1,cv138,13903,19,the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .,neg
1,cv138,13903,20,frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode .,neg
1,cv138,13903,21,i wasn't alive then .,neg
1,cv138,13903,22,i don't even watch television now .,neg
1,cv138,13903,23,"i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse .",neg
1,cv138,13903,24,"i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .",neg
1,cv138,13903,25,i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .,neg
1,cv138,13903,26,"based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .",neg
1,cv138,13903,27,"they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) .",neg
1,cv138,13903,28,it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .,neg
1,cv138,13903,29,his name is de wynter ( connery ) .,neg

1,cv138,13903,35,"along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense .",neg
1,cv138,13903,36,"for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .",neg
1,cv138,13903,37,"now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film .",neg
1,cv138,13903,38,"the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .",neg
1,cv138,13903,39,"they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .",neg
1,cv138,13903,40,"the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .",neg
1,cv138,13903,41,"like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .",neg
1,cv138,13903,42,"and i guarantee you , it will wane .",neg
1,cv138,13903,43,i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think .,neg
1,cv138,13903,44,the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens .,neg
1,cv138,13903,45,there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut .,neg
1,cv138,13903,46,"in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .",neg
1,cv138,13903,47,"the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .",neg
1,cv138,13903,48,they aren't .,neg

1,cv138,13903,51,and what about this wasted cast ?,neg
1,cv138,13903,52,"oh , it makes me weep with disappointment .",neg
1,cv138,13903,53,"we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * .",neg
1,cv138,13903,54,i love the guy .,neg
1,cv138,13903,55,"i've loved all his films , until this one .",neg
1,cv138,13903,56,"he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are .",neg

1,cv138,13903,58,"( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )",neg
1,cv138,13903,59,"connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .",neg
1,cv138,13903,60,who is to blame ?,neg
1,cv138,13903,61,"is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?",neg
1,cv138,13903,62,"perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .",neg
1,cv138,13903,63,is it the actors ?,neg
1,cv138,13903,64,"for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .",neg
1,cv138,13903,65,"i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with .",neg
1,cv138,13903,66,"his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .",neg
1,cv138,13903,67,"add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .",neg
1,cv138,13903,68,"if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design .",neg
1,cv138,13903,69,"the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .",neg
1,cv138,13903,70,"i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense .",neg
1,cv138,13903,71,"i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .",neg
1,cv138,13903,72,"i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits .",neg
1,cv138,13903,73,"but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here .",neg
1,cv138,13903,74,"inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .",neg
1,cv138,13903,75,maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story .,neg

1,cv138,13903,77,"most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles .",neg
1,cv138,13903,78,damn this movie for not giving them the chance .,neg

1,cv139,14236,4,( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip .,neg
1,cv139,14236,5,"for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup .",neg
1,cv139,14236,6,"this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . )",neg
1,cv139,14236,7,"snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater .",neg

1,cv139,14236,12,"and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ?",neg
1,cv139,14236,13,the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer .,neg
1,cv139,14236,14,"if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate .",neg
1,cv139,14236,15,the trailer is a work of sheer genius .,neg
1,cv139,14236,16,"it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot .",neg
1,cv139,14236,17,the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross .,neg
1,cv139,14236,18,"( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? )",neg
1,cv139,14236,19,but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie .,neg
1,cv139,14236,20,the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match .,neg
1,cv139,14236,21,"unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot .",neg
1,cv139,14236,22,"the trailer gives away much , too much of the story .",neg
1,cv139,14236,23,"the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy .",neg
1,cv139,14236,24,"the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is .",neg
1,cv139,14236,25,"without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level .",neg
1,cv139,14236,26,"as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit .",neg
1,cv139,14236,27,de palma is maddeningly inconsistent .,neg
1,cv139,14236,28,"he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) .",neg
1,cv139,14236,29,"on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) .",neg
1,cv139,14236,30,"snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value .",neg
1,cv139,14236,31,the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor .,neg
1,cv139,14236,32,"there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done .",neg
1,cv139,14236,33,this is what's called giving the devil his due .,neg
1,cv139,14236,34,but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie .,neg
1,cv139,14236,35,"placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years .",neg
1,cv139,14236,36,"snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent .",neg
1,cv139,14236,37,"cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better .",neg
1,cv139,14236,38,"the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind .",neg
1,cv139,14236,39,"however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .",neg
1,cv140,7963,0,"the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , "" i think we need a bigger bat cave , "" or something to that note .",neg
1,cv140,7963,1,that's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much .,neg
1,cv140,7963,2,cut batgirl out .,neg
1,cv140,7963,3,cut one of the villains .,neg
1,cv140,7963,4,it's too much to handle in one dosage .,neg

1,cv140,7963,7,and elle deserves better .,neg
1,cv140,7963,8,this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher .,neg
1,cv140,7963,9,it's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) .,neg
1,cv140,7963,10,"the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) .",neg

1,cv140,7963,17,he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?,neg

1,cv140,7963,20,"meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .",neg
1,cv140,7963,21,she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .,neg

1,cv170,29808,34,in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .,neg
1,cv170,29808,35,what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ),neg
1,cv170,29808,36,playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .,neg
1,cv170,29808,37,the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .,neg
1,cv170,29808,38,then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .,neg
1,cv170,29808,39,the audience expectation is that they will add up .,neg
1,cv170,29808,40,but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .,neg
1,cv170,29808,41,lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .,neg
1,cv170,29808,42,"in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .",neg
1,cv170,29808,43,there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .,neg
1,cv170,29808,44,mad magazine called it a poiuyt .,neg
1,cv170,29808,45,other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .,neg
1,cv170,29808,46,look at small portions of it and makes sense .,neg
1,cv170,29808,47,look at the whole figure and it does not .,neg

1,cv171,15164,2,"synopsis : this is the fourth film in the chucky series , which debuted in the late 1980s .",neg
1,cv171,15164,3,"basically , chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer .",neg
1,cv171,15164,4,"in bride of chucky , chucky's longtime girlfriend tiffany ( jennifer tilly ) dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo .",neg
1,cv171,15164,5,"dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey , where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans .",neg
1,cv171,15164,6,"the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer .",neg
1,cv171,15164,7,"opinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn't succeed .",neg
1,cv171,15164,8,"somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky .",neg
1,cv171,15164,9,"and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany .",neg
1,cv171,15164,10,"the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half .",neg
1,cv171,15164,11,the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic .,neg
1,cv172,12037,0,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .",neg
1,cv172,12037,1,"if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .",neg
1,cv172,12037,2,"alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .",neg
1,cv172,12037,3,what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .,neg
1,cv172,12037,4,"that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .",neg
1,cv172,12037,5,"when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .",neg
1,cv172,12037,6,so why such a seemingly high rating ?,neg
1,cv172,12037,7,there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .,neg
1,cv172,12037,8,"first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .",neg
1,cv172,12037,9,the sound and screen kicked ass .,neg
1,cv172,12037,10,nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .,neg
1,cv172,12037,11,"also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension .",neg
1,cv172,12037,12,i even liked the computer-generated settings .,neg
1,cv172,12037,13,"i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .",neg
1,cv172,12037,14,"also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .",neg
1,cv172,12037,15,william hurt isn't too bad either .,neg
1,cv172,12037,16,"neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .",neg
1,cv172,12037,17,"and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .",neg
1,cv172,12037,18,"there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) .",neg
1,cv172,12037,19,it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .,neg
1,cv172,12037,20,"those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .",neg
1,cv172,12037,21,that type of moviemaking is a lost art .,neg
1,cv172,12037,22,now for the bad news .,neg
1,cv172,12037,23,worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .,neg
1,cv172,12037,24,"it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .",neg
1,cv172,12037,25,""" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line .",neg
1,cv172,12037,26,"and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .",neg
1,cv172,12037,27,"second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .",neg
1,cv172,12037,28,"the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .",neg
1,cv172,12037,29,"once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .",neg
1,cv172,12037,30,"when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' """,neg
1,cv172,12037,31,then there's the tone of the movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,32,the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .,neg
1,cv172,12037,33,then it could be an adventure movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,34,"they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off .",neg
1,cv172,12037,35,"still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .",neg
1,cv172,12037,36,"just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family .",neg
1,cv172,12037,37,many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .,neg
1,cv172,12037,38,and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,39,"in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .",neg
1,cv172,12037,40,we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .,neg
1,cv172,12037,41,"in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .",neg
1,cv172,12037,42,that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .,neg
1,cv172,12037,43,"finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .",neg
1,cv172,12037,44,the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .,neg
1,cv172,12037,45,why ?,neg
1,cv172,12037,46,why bother saying what year this is .,neg
1,cv172,12037,47,just tell us it's the future .,neg
1,cv172,12037,48,i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .,neg
1,cv172,12037,49,setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .,neg
1,cv172,12037,50,then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .,neg
1,cv172,12037,51,"this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics .",neg
1,cv172,12037,52,one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .,neg
1,cv172,12037,53,"the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .",neg
1,cv172,12037,54,this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,55,"but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .",neg
1,cv172,12037,56,"still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards .",neg
1,cv173,4295,0,"i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .",neg
1,cv173,4295,1,"luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !",neg

1,cv173,4295,3,i got it .,neg
1,cv173,4295,4,"well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .",neg
1,cv173,4295,5,this movie really sucks .,neg
1,cv173,4295,6,it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !,neg
1,cv173,4295,7,"for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?",neg
1,cv173,4295,8,jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .,neg
1,cv173,4295,9,"the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all .",neg
1,cv173,4295,10,the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .,neg
1,cv173,4295,11,i didn't even finish the movie . . .,neg
1,cv173,4295,12,i couldn't take it anymore .,neg
1,cv173,4295,13,"note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie .",neg
1,cv173,4295,14,it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff .,neg
1,cv173,4295,15,aditya panscholi is the sidekick again .,neg
1,cv173,4295,16,"( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .",neg
1,cv173,4295,17,"he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie )",neg
1,cv174,9735,0,starship troopers is a bad movie .,neg
1,cv174,9735,1,"i mean , a really , really , bad movie .",neg
1,cv174,9735,2,"not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .",neg
1,cv174,9735,3,"looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .",neg
1,cv174,9735,4,"that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .",neg
1,cv174,9735,5,"the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .",neg
1,cv174,9735,6,"as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .",neg
1,cv174,9735,7,"eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .",neg
1,cv174,9735,8,"as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .",neg
1,cv174,9735,9,""" what ? """,neg

1,cv174,9735,14,"nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !",neg
1,cv174,9735,15,i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .,neg
1,cv174,9735,16,"as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .",neg
1,cv174,9735,17,"two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .",neg
1,cv174,9735,18,"this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .",neg
1,cv174,9735,19,"again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !",neg
1,cv174,9735,20,"in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .",neg
1,cv174,9735,21,"he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !",neg
1,cv174,9735,22,"this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .",neg

1,cv174,9735,24,"i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly .",neg
1,cv174,9735,25,"in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .",neg

1,cv182,7791,21,"in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .",neg
1,cv182,7791,22,it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .,neg

1,cv187,14112,24,"there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works .",neg
1,cv187,14112,25,"most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane .",neg
1,cv187,14112,26,"there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development .",neg

1,cv187,14112,30,this one doesn't .,neg

2,cv200,29006,45,it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .,neg
2,cv200,29006,46,this is a further abandonment of the source material .,neg

2,cv200,29006,52,they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .,neg
2,cv200,29006,53,"the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn't like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .",neg

2,cv200,29006,55,the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .,neg
2,cv200,29006,56,this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .,neg

2,cv200,29006,59,in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .,neg

2,cv200,29006,68,one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .,neg
2,cv200,29006,69,since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .,neg

2,cv202,11382,13,"hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) .",neg
2,cv202,11382,14,"this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks .",neg
2,cv202,11382,15,"frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) .",neg
2,cv202,11382,16,"meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object .",neg
2,cv202,11382,17,"as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn .",neg
2,cv202,11382,18,"here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle .",neg
2,cv202,11382,19,"of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation .",neg

2,cv202,11382,25,the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents .,neg
2,cv202,11382,26,that's about it for character development .,neg
2,cv202,11382,27,"beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists .",neg
2,cv202,11382,28,"however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying .",neg
2,cv202,11382,29,"i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion .",neg

2,cv202,11382,34,"most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good .",neg
2,cv202,11382,35,"films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along .",neg
2,cv202,11382,36,"in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension .",neg
2,cv202,11382,37,"that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care .",neg

2,cv203,19052,6,"opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .",neg
2,cv203,19052,7,that's the essence of big daddy .,neg
2,cv203,19052,8,but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing .,neg

2,cv203,19052,10,"on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies .",neg
2,cv203,19052,11,then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .,neg
2,cv203,19052,12,"folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .",neg

2,cv219,19874,11,my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .,neg
2,cv219,19874,12,"smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him .",neg

2,cv219,19874,15,what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office .,neg

2,cv219,19874,26,"salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon .",neg
2,cv219,19874,27,"branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .",neg
2,cv219,19874,28,but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .,neg

2,cv220,28906,20,"in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .",neg
2,cv220,28906,21,then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .,neg

2,cv220,28906,32,viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .,neg
2,cv220,28906,33,"and maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive .",neg

2,cv221,27081,12,"the focus of "" the cell "" in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality .",neg

8,cv849,17215,31,"however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted .",neg
8,cv849,17215,32,"instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies .",neg
8,cv849,17215,33,"first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot .",neg
8,cv849,17215,34,"at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot .",neg
8,cv849,17215,35,there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish .,neg
8,cv849,17215,36,not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .,neg
8,cv849,17215,37,"and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots .",neg
8,cv849,17215,38,"perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end .",neg
8,cv849,17215,39,but it didn't happen that way .,neg
8,cv849,17215,40,"the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .",neg
8,cv850,18185,0,"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same "" high concept "" .",neg

8,cv850,18185,2,"in few weeks , "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes .",neg
8,cv850,18185,3,"the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison .",neg
8,cv850,18185,4,"he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police .",neg
8,cv850,18185,5,"few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose .",neg

8,cv850,18185,7,"dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber .",neg
8,cv850,18185,8,"while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story .",neg
8,cv850,18185,9,and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed .,neg
8,cv850,18185,10,badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all .,neg
8,cv850,18185,11,"screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama .",neg
8,cv850,18185,12,"the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities .",neg
8,cv850,18185,13,"the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay .",neg
8,cv850,18185,14,"those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters .",neg
8,cv850,18185,15,"because of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times .",neg
8,cv850,18185,16,"the most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber .",neg
8,cv850,18185,17,his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself .,neg
8,cv850,18185,18,this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive .,neg
8,cv850,18185,19,"the film have few bright points , though .",neg
8,cv850,18185,20,"some of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) .",neg
8,cv850,18185,21,and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague .,neg
8,cv850,18185,22,"but , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor .",neg
8,cv851,21895,0,"don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .",neg
8,cv851,21895,1,"his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .",neg
8,cv851,21895,2,"but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .",neg
8,cv851,21895,3,"jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) .",neg
8,cv851,21895,4,"and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one .",neg
8,cv851,21895,5,"leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side .",neg
8,cv851,21895,6,"besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .",neg
8,cv851,21895,7,"yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences .",neg
8,cv851,21895,8,"the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal .",neg
8,cv851,21895,9,"that's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .",neg
8,cv851,21895,10,"that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall .",neg
8,cv851,21895,11,"as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .",neg
8,cv851,21895,12,"trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on .",neg
8,cv851,21895,13,"this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .",neg

8,cv852,27512,2,a black comedy set in the near future in a boarding house run by a depraved butcher .,neg
8,cv852,27512,3,"the comedy is played more in comic strip style for entertaining value than for deeper satire , as it features mostly zany sophomoric sight gags and relies heavily on special effects .",neg
8,cv852,27512,4,"the world has fallen on hard times and there are food shortages which include no meat , so the butcher serves up meat from human flesh to customers who pay with grain , almost as valued a commodity .",neg
8,cv852,27512,5,"that's the big joke in the film and the novelty of that cannibalism idea wears thin mighty fast , as the characters are too absurd and sketched too thinly for us to care about them .",neg

8,cv853,29119,9,"adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing .",neg
8,cv853,29119,10,osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .,neg

8,cv853,29119,18,"like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .",neg

8,cv858,20266,37,it makes no sense and the director gives the audience no reasoning for the ridiculous changes that take place in the film .,neg
8,cv858,20266,38,he forces the viewer to make various assumptions and does not give any in-depth information .,neg
8,cv858,20266,39,"for instance , the beginning of the film gives us a sense of why nell is getting involved in the program .",neg
8,cv858,20266,40,"but , we get zilch for the other four .",neg

8,cv872,13710,5,"sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process .",neg

8,cv872,13710,10,"unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality .",neg
8,cv872,13710,11,"death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out .",neg

8,cv872,13710,14,"bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine .",neg
8,cv872,13710,15,"although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film .",neg
8,cv872,13710,16,"the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade .",neg
8,cv872,13710,17,"on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey .",neg
8,cv872,13710,18,"unfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang .",neg
8,cv872,13710,19,"the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget .",neg

8,cv889,22670,18,"of course , we're already told that he's innocent .",neg

8,cv889,22670,25,the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie .,neg

8,cv889,22670,31,but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence .,neg
8,cv889,22670,32,thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .,neg

8,cv890,3515,5,"your adaptation of the basketball diaries is loud and one-dimensional , serving only as the vehicle for a performance by leonardo dicaprio that is better in pieces than it is as a whole .",neg
8,cv890,3515,6,"dicaprio stars as jim carroll , the new york poet/songwriter/ performer on whose autobiographical writings the film is based .",neg
8,cv890,3515,7,"as the film opens , jim is a budding high school basketball star given to petty thievery and getting drunk with buddies mickey ( mark wahlberg ) , pedro ( james madio ) and neutron ( patrick mcgaw ) .",neg

8,cv890,3515,9,"jim's addiction to the drug starts him on a downhill spiral , as he is kicked off the basketball team by his coach ( bruno kirby ) , kicked out of his home by his mother ( lorraine bracco ) , and drops out of school .",neg
8,cv890,3515,10,"along with mickey and pedro , jim becomes a victim of the street , living from fix to fix and sinking lower and lower .",neg
8,cv890,3515,11,"the basketball diaries has been bouncing around as a project for years , but the sticking point has always been that jim carroll as a character was too unsympathetic and too much a loner .",neg
8,cv890,3515,12,"screenwriter bryan goluboff created the three characters who act as carroll's posse , resulting in a jim carroll who is just as unsympathetic , but now with equally unsympathetic friends .",neg
8,cv890,3515,13,"as a film , the basketball diaries may be intended primarily as a cautionary tale , a 100 minute long "" just say no "" public service announcement , but as drama it is monumentally ineffective because it is impossible to care much about anyone in the movie .",neg
8,cv890,3515,14,"jim is sort of a jerk even before he becomes a junkie , but i suppose that his pseudo-sensitive poetry and his devotion to his terminally ill friend are intended to balance that out .",neg
8,cv890,3515,15,"perhaps we are expected to see jim as one of those "" good kids who falls in with the wrong crowd "" that every parent believes his or her troubled child to be ; i saw him simply as part of the bad crowd .",neg
8,cv890,3515,16,"without a character who changes in any appreciable way , the basketball diaries rapidly degenerates into a collection of crimes committed by jim and his strung-out cohorts , all choreographed to an oppressively loud soundtrack .",neg
8,cv890,3515,17,"director scott kalvert doesn't have many scenes with intrinsic dramatic impact with which to work , so he substitutes silly slow-motion photography , self-consciously funky camera angles and choppy editing .",neg
8,cv890,3515,18,"on only one occasion , when a steady pan around a room where jim is trying to detox makes it appear that the walls are closing in , are any of the gimmicks effective .",neg
8,cv890,3515,19,"mostly , they just draw attention to how hollow the story is .",neg
8,cv890,3515,20,they also don't allow leonardo dicaprio's performance to be as strong as it could have been .,neg
8,cv890,3515,21,"for every impressive moment , like his desperate attempt to get his mother to give him money , there is a scene where kalvert pulls too much of the focus to his own camera theatrics .",neg
8,cv890,3515,22,"dicaprio is most effective when he is playing off other actors , particularly a fine sequence featuring ernie hudson as an ex-junkie who tries to help jim straighten out , but kalvert won't let character interaction define this story .",neg
8,cv890,3515,23,"he wants to turn dicaprio into a rock star , shooting him in dramatic fashion but denying him the opportunity to do much acting .",neg
8,cv890,3515,24,"at isolate moments , the basketball diaries is a fine showcase for dicaprio's talents .",neg
8,cv890,3515,25,"far more frequently , it looks like kalvert is trying to imagine what a long form velvet underground video might have looked like .",neg
8,cv891,6035,0,"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line .",neg
8,cv891,6035,1,"new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons .",neg
8,cv891,6035,2,"the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ .",neg
8,cv891,6035,3,it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself .,neg
8,cv891,6035,4,"this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico .",neg
8,cv891,6035,5,"by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border .",neg
8,cv891,6035,6,one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) .,neg

8,cv891,6035,8,"but smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them .",neg
8,cv891,6035,9,"viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations .",neg
8,cv891,6035,10,"there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire .",neg
8,cv891,6035,11,"director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture .",neg
8,cv891,6035,12,"what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction .",neg
8,cv891,6035,13,"yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling .",neg
8,cv891,6035,14,the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters .,neg
8,cv891,6035,15,"they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status .",neg
8,cv891,6035,16,"with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive .",neg
8,cv891,6035,17,"it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work .",neg
8,cv891,6035,18,"the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence .",neg
8,cv891,6035,19,"even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction .",neg
8,cv891,6035,20,"willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else .",neg
8,cv891,6035,21,"christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression .",neg
8,cv891,6035,22,"with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about .",neg
8,cv891,6035,23,"cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration .",neg

9,cv907,3193,20,perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics .,neg
9,cv907,3193,21,"the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for .",neg
9,cv907,3193,22,"he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background .",neg

9,cv950,13478,29,"generally , though , elfont and kaplan do have graceful camera movement , and even manage to capture an altman-esque feel to their film from time to time ( a thing with a note , though , is too hokey to really be admirable ) .",neg
9,cv950,13478,30,"i actually did like seth green , for once in about a decade ( when he played a very young woody allen in "" radio days "" ) - his desintegration of his wigger character was almost believable . . . almost .",neg
9,cv950,13478,31,"and , of course , lauren ambrose is wonderful as denise , the one character we could have used some more of , even though it would have changed the entirety of the film .",neg
9,cv950,13478,32,"however , the character of denise really doesn't work with the film , when really thought about .",neg
9,cv950,13478,33,"she's far too witty and realized ( at least for the first half ) to belong in this film , and whenever she appears , she automatically gives everything a delightfully satirical tone .",neg

9,cv950,13478,36,"a couple other things that just don't work : mike's character , who suffers an epiphany throughout the film but in the end acts as though he has forgotten everything : too much the sacrificial lamb for the film in general ; the aimless , bitchy driving by preston to try and get over his inability to shack up with amanda - give me a break ; and perhaps the one thing that just doesn't work at all : jenna eflman's uncredited cameo as an angel - just didn't work , but nice try .",neg
9,cv950,13478,37,"basically the worst thing about this film , the real reason i'm giving this such a low rating , is because it refuses to give us any fully realized characters and then insists we follow around complete stereotypes from other movies doing things that are inane and unlike anything we'd do .",neg

9,cv951,11816,4,mercury rising treats autism with the same degree of efficiency that many action thrillers accord to alcoholism .,neg

9,cv951,11816,22,"for those who are desperate to find elements of this movie to like , mercury rising manages to manufacture tension from time-to-time , but even the most exciting scenes ( such as the one where art and simon are crouched down , avoiding passing trains ) aren't that pulse-pounding .",neg

9,cv956,12547,6,this is the third straight movie in a row where emmerich and devlin have demonstrated that a mastery of computer-generated visuals is far more important for making money than the ability to write and direct for actors .,neg
9,cv956,12547,7,stargate was a financial success .,neg
9,cv956,12547,8,independence day was a runaway hit .,neg

9,cv956,12547,18,( how disturbing is it to know that godzilla has been chosen to close the 51st cannes film festival ? ),neg
9,cv956,12547,19,"worst of all , godzilla isn't even exciting .",neg

9,cv956,12547,21,even the scenes with dozens of aircraft attacking the monster are so devoid of tension and suspense that they are yawn-provoking .,neg
9,cv956,12547,22,"independence day may have been dumb , but it was full of "" adrenaline moments "" capable of getting the audience involved in the action .",neg
9,cv956,12547,23,"in this aspect of its production , as in so many others , godzilla is lacking .",neg
9,cv956,12547,24,"actually , part of the problem is that we're never sure who we're supposed to be rooting for : the green monster with an attitude or the paper-thin humans trying to stop him .",neg
9,cv956,12547,25,"the plot , such as it is , can be summed up rather simply .",neg
9,cv956,12547,26,"after sinking a few ships and leaving some footprints on tropical islands , godzilla shows up in the big apple .",neg
9,cv956,12547,27,"he does some of the usual tourist things : stops by madison square garden , visits the chrysler building , goes on a walk through central park , and takes the subway .",neg
9,cv956,12547,28,"in the process , he knocks over a few buildings and steps on countless cabs , but he never has trouble with traffic jams .",neg
9,cv956,12547,29,"on hand to stop him is an elite u . s . army unit , led by a slightly less-arrogant-than-usual military man ( kevin dunn ) and a biologist named nick tatopoulos , who has a theory about godzilla .",neg
9,cv956,12547,30,"in his opinion , the big guy is actually a lizard grown to enormous proportions as a result of the radiation given off by french atomic bomb tests in the south pacific .",neg
9,cv956,12547,31,"in nick's words , godzilla is "" a mutated aberration ? an incipient creature ? the first of its kind . """,neg
9,cv956,12547,32,"as luck would have it , nick's old girlfriend , audrey ( maria pitillo ) , is a reporter based at a new york tv station .",neg

9,cv956,12547,34,"then , just when the military has rejected nick's theory about why godzilla is in new york , a member of the french secret service ( jean reno ) recruits him for a special assignment .",neg
9,cv956,12547,35,"instead of stomping around tokyo this time , godzilla has chosen new york city .",neg
9,cv956,12547,36,"unfortunately , manhattan has been destroyed so many times in recent disaster movies ( independence day , deep impact , armageddon ) that it's becoming boring .",neg
9,cv956,12547,37,"the whole tradition of monsters roaming around the city started with king kong , but the big ape was only about 30 feet tall .",neg

9,cv956,12547,39,"at ten times that height , godzilla would be more likely to knock it over .",neg
9,cv956,12547,40,godzilla contains a few lame attempts at humor .,neg
9,cv956,12547,41,"there's an ongoing feud between animal and his wife that plays like sit-com material , an unfunny and repetitive gag about how no one can pronounce nick's last name properly , and a rather tame attack on film critics roger ebert and gene siskel .",neg
9,cv956,12547,42,"both of the popular personalities have alter egos in the film : "" ebert , "" the mayor of new york , is played by michael lerner , and "" gene "" ( lorry goldman ) is his campaign manager .",neg

9,cv956,12547,45,"and , although the "" characters "" don't serve any real purpose , they keep popping up .",neg
9,cv956,12547,46,godzilla is saddled with an unimpressive cast .,neg
9,cv956,12547,47,this is largely because emmerich doesn't want to risk a human performance upstaging his lizard .,neg
9,cv956,12547,48,"that's not to say that matthew broderick and jean reno aren't capable of good performances ( both have done their share of solid acting in the past ) , but they aren't a-list names .",neg
9,cv956,12547,49,"then again , considering the quality of the writing , even pacino and deniro would have been hard- pressed to shine .",neg
9,cv956,12547,50,maria pitillo ( dear god ) plays the love interest and hank azaria ( great expectations ) is on hand to present what is supposed to be comic relief .,neg
9,cv956,12547,51,"ultimately , it doesn't really matter what i ( or any other critic , for that matter ) have to say about the movie .",neg
9,cv956,12547,52,"tristar has assumed that godzilla , like all self-proclaimed summer event motion pictures , is pretty much critic-proof .",neg

9,cv957,9059,8,the idea at the film's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds .,neg

9,cv975,11920,13,"although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book .",neg
9,cv975,11920,14,"rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women .",neg

9,cv975,11920,16,"no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling .",neg

9,cv975,11920,24,"cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none .",neg
9,cv975,11920,25,"he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull .",neg
9,cv975,11920,26,"the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth .",neg
9,cv975,11920,27,"but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical .",neg
9,cv975,11920,28,"the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties .",neg
9,cv975,11920,29,"because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona .",neg
9,cv975,11920,30,we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all .,neg
9,cv975,11920,31,"consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost .",neg
9,cv975,11920,32,the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind .,neg
9,cv975,11920,33,"despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code .",neg
9,cv975,11920,34,"the title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law .",neg
9,cv975,11920,35,"unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment .",neg
9,cv975,11920,36,"in this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality .",neg
9,cv975,11920,37,"the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own .",neg
9,cv975,11920,38,"if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .",neg
9,cv975,11920,39,"maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie .",neg
9,cv975,11920,40,"the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance .",neg
9,cv975,11920,41,"spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him .",neg
9,cv975,11920,42,"of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) .",neg

9,cv980,11851,22,"the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .",neg
9,cv980,11851,23,practically every line is just stating the obvious .,neg

9,cv980,11851,26,"the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess .",neg
9,cv980,11851,27,"there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .",neg
9,cv980,11851,28,"i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .",neg
9,cv980,11851,29,"but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .",neg
9,cv980,11851,30,"finally , the film has no idea what genre to be .",neg
9,cv980,11851,31,levison can't handle his own plot .,neg
9,cv980,11851,32,"it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller .",neg
9,cv980,11851,33,"and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )",neg
9,cv980,11851,34,it's not all that bad though .,neg
9,cv980,11851,35,"the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit .",neg
9,cv980,11851,36,"but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie .",neg
9,cv980,11851,37,not really worth seeing .,neg
9,cv980,11851,38,overall rating= review by david wilcock,neg
9,cv981,16679,0,"director luis mandoki's last film was the superb , serious 1994 drama "" when a man loves a woman , "" but his luck has ultimately run out with his latest picture , "" message in a bottle , "" which is the worst type of romance , a movie that tugs so relentlessly and violently at the heartstrings that it miraculously manages to dry out your eyes rather than tear them up .",neg
9,cv981,16679,1,"everything that occurs can be telegraphed way in advance since this same type of story has been done many times before---and much better---so there's an absence of suspense , and the film ultimately moves at such a very , very deliberate pace , as if it is trying to make great , "" meaningful "" statements and plot developments , that it just becomes a tedious bore to sit through .",neg
9,cv981,16679,2,""" message in a bottle "" begins with theresa osborne ( robin wright penn ) , a single mother and researcher at the chicago tribune , whom finds a bottle washed up on shore as she is jogging one day .",neg
9,cv981,16679,3,"inside the bottle is an anonymous love letter addressed to a mystery woman named catherine , and theresa is so taken aback by its honesty and sweetness that she shows it around at her work and , to her objection , finds that her editor has placed the letter in the newspaper .",neg
9,cv981,16679,4,"soon , a heavy research is conducted to find out who wrote the letter based on the type of bottle and a ship logo on the top of the typed message , and after it is traced to a man named garrett blake , theresa finds herself traveling to the outer banks , a boating town in north carolina , to find out the specifics of the message .",neg
9,cv981,16679,5,"of course , garrett turns out to be a handsome , rugged man around theresa's age and played by kevin costner .",neg
9,cv981,16679,6,"she is immediately charmed by him , but hesitant to unveil the truth of why she is there , and finds that catherine was garrett's late wife who died a few years earlier .",neg
9,cv981,16679,7,do you think you know where this is headed ?,neg
9,cv981,16679,8,"most likely you do , and i wouldn't call it giving away anything to say that by the picture's end , the movie has fallen into deep , artificial melodrama that i didn't buy for a second .",neg
9,cv981,16679,9,"if there are any positive things to say about "" message in a bottle , "" it is that the performances by robin wright penn and paul newman , as garrett's stubborn , but loving father , are far above par to be in such a wasteful , "" shaggy dog "" love story , and that the cinematography by caleb deschanel takes great advantage of the beautiful eastern coast , and paints chicago as an equally alluring city .",neg
9,cv981,16679,10,"meanwhile , costner has yet to redeem himself for some of the less-than-stellar films that he has made recently .",neg
9,cv981,16679,11,"it seems that with such bad luck , he wouldn't want to make another movie set near water , but here he is again with one of the main , and most ridiculous , centerpieces set on a storm-swept sea .",neg
9,cv981,16679,12,"the other actors are all , sadly , wasted , including illeana douglas , an underused actress who seems to always get stuck with the "" friend "" roles , here playing penn's confidante and co-worker at the tribune .",neg
9,cv981,16679,13,"the first half of "" message in a bottle "" plays like a hum-drum , trite television movie for the lifetime channel , as theresa spends a great deal of time "" getting to know "" garrett , with dialogue that is not the least bit stimulating or entertaining .",neg
9,cv981,16679,14,"usually , i am the type of person to practically salivate over dialogue-laden sequences since the film is no doubt trying to develop the characters and their relationships , but here it all rang with a resounding falseness since the dialogue felt "" written , "" and not as if people were really "" talking . """,neg
9,cv981,16679,15,"when the main characters of a film have very little of interest to say to each other , and are not particularly interesting themselves , you know immediately that you are in trouble .",neg
9,cv981,16679,16,"i swear that while watching "" message in a bottle , "" i felt as if i had just read the screenplay in its entirety before arriving at the theater ( heck , in actuality i'm not even familiar to the novel this is based on , by nicholas sparks ) .",neg
9,cv981,16679,17,"always one step ahead of the characters , the movie ran so closely and tightly to the constraints of the tried-and-true hollywood melodrama , the film strip often seemed to almost be in danger of tearing .",neg
9,cv981,16679,18,"nobody wins prizes for guessing that garrett will eventually find out theresa's secret , and that several obstacles will come within their ways of living happily ever after .",neg
9,cv981,16679,19,"this same exact problem occurred in last year's very , very similar ( watch this , and you will realize just how similar i mean ) meg ryan-nicolas cage romantic drama , "" city of angels . """,neg
9,cv981,16679,20,"although theresa is deeply touched by the "" heartfelt "" letter that she finds in the bottle , perhaps the filmakers might have been better off finding a message in a bottle of their own , preferably before filming began .",neg
9,cv981,16679,21,"it should have read , "" memo to screenwriters : use you brain ! """,neg
9,cv982,22209,0,i remember really enjoying this movie when i saw it years ago .,neg
9,cv982,22209,1,i guess my memory really sucks .,neg
9,cv982,22209,2,"there is very , very little that is funny in caddyshack .",neg
9,cv982,22209,3,"the laughs are few , and far between , and what there are really aren't that great .",neg
9,cv982,22209,4,"caddyshack , as the name implies , more or less centers on one young caddy working at an exclusive country club .",neg
9,cv982,22209,5,michael o'keefe plays said caddy .,neg
9,cv982,22209,6,"why they cast this unknown , fairly untalented actor in the lead role is completely beyond me .",neg
9,cv982,22209,7,"the movie doesn't seem to have a real plot , just a series of scenes that are little more than opportunities for the rest of the cast to mug at the camera .",neg
9,cv982,22209,8,"the only real story , if you can call it that , was a subplot involving the mentally disturbed greens keeper , bill murray , who is having his own private little war against a gopher who is ruining the course .",neg
9,cv982,22209,9,most of the marginal laughs come from rodney dangerfield and ted knight mugging and overacting for the camera -- with painfully limited success .,neg
9,cv982,22209,10,"bill murray is slightly amusing in places , but fairly wasted .",neg
9,cv982,22209,11,"the biggest waste of all is chevy chase , who didn't even crack a smile on my face with his character's lame zen-like approach to golfing .",neg
9,cv982,22209,12,"there are a few decent scenes involving the interaction between dangerfield and knight , but they are far too infrequent to carry the movie .",neg
9,cv982,22209,13,i guess that's what you get for basing a story around an unknown kid .,neg
9,cv982,22209,14,"i'm not sure what the writers of this thing were thinking of , but i really think it was something far removed from comedy as they were putting pen to paper .",neg
9,cv982,22209,15,nothing about this movie works .,neg
9,cv982,22209,16,it wouldn't have taken a genius to figure out that this thing wasn't going to fly .,neg
9,cv982,22209,17,most of the scenes just couldn't possibly be funny .,neg
9,cv982,22209,18,it's as if the writers where off in their own little brain damaged world .,neg
9,cv982,22209,19,i'm sure scenes involving chevy chase and his oneness with the golf ball were supposed to be funny .,neg
9,cv982,22209,20,"in reality , they were painfully embarrassing to watch .",neg
9,cv982,22209,21,"there is a scene at the club pool where all the caddies go wild for the "" hot babe "" of the movie walking by in her bikini .",neg
9,cv982,22209,22,olive oil would have filled out this swimsuit better than this girl .,neg
9,cv982,22209,23,everything about this movie was just completely implausible as far as the comedy was concerned .,neg
9,cv982,22209,24,maybe if you were drunk out of you mind or high off some sort of illegal narcotic this thing might be funny .,neg
9,cv982,22209,25,"but for the rest of us , stay the hell away from caddyshack .",neg
9,cv983,24219,0,tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse .,neg
9,cv983,24219,1,the fugitive ?,neg
9,cv983,24219,2,"not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had .",neg
9,cv983,24219,3,"there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ?",neg
9,cv983,24219,4,oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man .,neg
9,cv983,24219,5,both movies are on video .,neg
9,cv983,24219,6,make the wise choice and pick the fugitive .,neg
9,cv983,24219,7,"there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable .",neg

9,cv983,24219,9,"learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary .",neg

9,cv983,24219,11,director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son .,neg
9,cv983,24219,12,"every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture .",neg
9,cv983,24219,13,"in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something .",neg
9,cv983,24219,14,"all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son . """,neg
9,cv983,24219,15,"nothing more , nothing less .",neg
9,cv983,24219,16,"dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself .",neg
9,cv983,24219,17,libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough .,neg
9,cv983,24219,18,"ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones .",neg
9,cv983,24219,19,winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles .,neg
9,cv983,24219,20,people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right .,neg
9,cv983,24219,21,though i don't think he will win another oscar again .,neg
9,cv983,24219,22,the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons .,neg
9,cv983,24219,23,"even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count .",neg
9,cv983,24219,24,"burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups .",neg
9,cv983,24219,25,the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .,neg
9,cv983,24219,26,hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent .,neg
9,cv983,24219,27,that would just be plain stupid .,neg
9,cv984,14006,0,"while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) .",neg
9,cv984,14006,1,"so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival .",neg
9,cv984,14006,2,"strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life .",neg

9,cv984,14006,4,"easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as .",neg
9,cv984,14006,5,"so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends .",neg
9,cv984,14006,6,director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot .,neg
9,cv984,14006,7,"until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging .",neg
9,cv984,14006,8,"that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it .",neg
9,cv984,14006,9,"the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) .",neg
9,cv984,14006,10,"one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for .",neg
9,cv984,14006,11,"not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty .",neg
9,cv984,14006,12,the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ .,neg
9,cv984,14006,13,"whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go .",neg
9,cv984,14006,14,_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through .,neg
9,cv984,14006,15,"as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . .",neg
9,cv984,14006,16,like a zombie .,neg

9,cv995,23113,35,"the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding !",neg

9,cv995,23113,52,which one is it ?,neg
9,cv995,23113,53,"the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .",neg

9,cv996,12447,25,that line alone is worth the movie's cult following .,neg

9,cv996,12447,27,"once there , the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them .",neg
9,cv996,12447,28,"they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up .",neg
9,cv996,12447,29,"i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is .",neg
9,cv996,12447,30,"it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .",neg
9,cv996,12447,31,"just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker .",neg
9,cv996,12447,32,"boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance , "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort .",neg
9,cv996,12447,33,"he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor .",neg
9,cv996,12447,34,"sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace .",neg
9,cv996,12447,35,"he got exactly that in "" zardoz , "" and it's a wonder it didn't end his career .",neg
9,cv996,12447,36,i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .,neg
9,cv996,12447,37,is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ?,neg
9,cv996,12447,38,is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ?,neg
9,cv996,12447,39,"or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ?",neg
9,cv996,12447,40,karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary .,neg
9,cv996,12447,41,"come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip .",neg
9,cv996,12447,42,people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .,neg
9,cv997,5152,0,the kids in the hall are an acquired taste .,neg
9,cv997,5152,1,it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer .,neg
9,cv997,5152,2,"maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen .",neg
9,cv997,5152,3,"my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film .",neg
9,cv997,5152,4,"as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv .",neg
9,cv997,5152,5,a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show .,neg
9,cv997,5152,6,"the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so .",neg
9,cv997,5152,7,and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics .,neg

9,cv997,5152,12,the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film .,neg
9,cv997,5152,13,"at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long .",neg
9,cv997,5152,14,"the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit .",neg
9,cv997,5152,15,"but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough .",neg
9,cv997,5152,16,"strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv .",neg
9,cv997,5152,17,the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating .,neg
9,cv997,5152,18,"one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower .",neg

9,cv998,15691,0,there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director .,neg
9,cv998,15691,1,"of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , "" halloween , "" but he also made 1980's "" the fog , "" and 1987's underrated , "" prince of darkness . """,neg
9,cv998,15691,2,"heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with "" in the mouth of madness . """,neg
9,cv998,15691,3,"but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , "" memoirs of an invisible man . """,neg
9,cv998,15691,4,"somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , "" village of the damned , "" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , "" escape from l . a . "" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , "" john carpenter's vampires . """,neg
9,cv998,15691,5,"if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title .",neg
9,cv998,15691,6,"it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires . """,neg
9,cv998,15691,7,the story is simple .,neg
9,cv998,15691,8,"jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .",neg
9,cv998,15691,9,"since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her .",neg
9,cv998,15691,10,"it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .",neg
9,cv998,15691,11,my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ?,neg
9,cv998,15691,12,"well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made .",neg
9,cv998,15691,13,""" john carpenter's vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen .",neg
9,cv998,15691,14,"in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .",neg
9,cv998,15691,15,"the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .",neg
9,cv998,15691,16,"and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .",neg
9,cv998,15691,17,"there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .",neg
9,cv998,15691,18,"james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue .",neg
9,cv998,15691,19,"daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .",neg
9,cv998,15691,20,"and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .",neg
9,cv998,15691,21,"there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter's vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .",neg
9,cv998,15691,22,"he has said that he turned down directing , "" halloween : h20 , "" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it .",neg
9,cv998,15691,23,"and yet , when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it .",neg
9,cv998,15691,24,"i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points .",neg

9,cv999,14636,4,_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels .,neg

9,cv999,14636,8,"there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak .",neg
9,cv999,14636,9,"that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .",neg

9,cv999,14636,19,"granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .",neg
9,cv999,14636,20,that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .,neg
9,cv999,14636,21,"like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .",neg
